###### **1.【P.21】 generalizations**

When people from other cultures declare that all Americans have tattoos, listen to hip-hop, and eat mostly fast food, they are generalizing. When Americans conclude that Oktoberfest shows that the Germans like beer and sausage, they are generalizing. And when people say that the Irish are usually short tempered, Mexicans are normally late for meetings, and Asians seem to be good at math, they are generalizing. When someone proclaims that California wine is better than that from France or Australia, they are also generalizing. These examples are representative of an endless number of cultural generalizations people use when talking about other groups. When we generalize, we are allowing a few instances to represent an entire class of events, people, or experiences. It is easy to fall into the trap of employing generalizations, as they are easy to arrive at. For example, think how easy it is to make a decision about another culture if, after meeting several international students from India, you concluded that everyone in India spoke English. These sorts of cultural generalizations are popular because they are casy to create, as they rely on limited samples. In addi-tion, when repeated with enough regularity, they become shorthand to represent an entire collection of people, events, or things. As you might expect, the study of intercultural communication, which implies learning about other people and their cul tures, is the perfect arena to misuse generalizations, as it is tempting to generalize about an entire collectivity of people when discussing their qualities and "typical" behaviors.

Generalizations are based on limited data and are then applied to a larger popula-tion. In intercultural communication, this means ascribing characteristics to a larger group of people based on attributes displayed by a smaller group. Stereotypes differ from generalizations in that they may not be based solely on conjecture and usually appeal to the audience's positive or negative emotions. For example, "All Asian students make good grades" is a stereotype. A generalization would be, "Records indicate that Asian students are likely to make good grades."

Although generalizing can be a problem when studying intercultural communica-tion, certain precautions can be taken (as we have endeavored to do in this book) to minimize the misleading effects of generalizing. First, cultural generalizations must be viewed as approximations, not as absolute representations. Your personal experiences have taught you that people often do not follow the prescribed and accepted modes of cultural behavior. You may read about social conformity as a trait of the Japanese peo-ple, but while in Tokyo, you see an elderly woman with green hair and a group of young men wearing hip-hop clothes. In instances such as these, remember the admonition of the English writer Robert Burton: "No rule is so general, which admits not some exception." 

Second, when you do make generalizations, they should deal with the primary values and behaviors of a particular culture. It is these core values and learned behaviors that occur with enough regularity and over a long enough period of time that tend to correctly identify the members of a particular culture. If you examine the dominant culture of the United States, you will have little trouble noticing the importance placed on individualism in everything from dress to outward behavior. In the same manner, you could begin to get insight into the different gender roles in Saudi Arabia by noticing how few women drive cars, hold public office, or appear in public in Western attire. What you will notice about these two examples, although there might be exceptions, is that the culturally instilled behaviors in both are easily recognizable. You can see a somewhat consistent pattern in something as simple as greeting behaviors. For example, in Mexico, friends usually embrace; in India, people bow; and in the United States, people typically shake hands. These kinds of behaviors are recognizable because of their consistency over an extended period, usually involv-

ing generation after generation.

Third, when employing generalizations, try to use those that can be supported by a variety of sources. Insufficient and/or limited samples often produce unwarranted con-clusions. While reading this book, you will notice that we have used hundreds of reliable references to validate many of our conclusions. This sort of "research" is especially useful when seeking to substantiate a generalization concerning a culture where one's fund of knowledge might be limited.

Finally, conclusions and statements about cultures should be qualified so that they appear not as absolutes but only as cautious generalizations. For example, although this is only the first chapter of the book, you might have noticed how frequently we have used words such as "often" or "usually" to avoid speaking in unconditional terms. Coles adds to our list of qualifying terms, suggesting phrases such as "on aver-age," "more likely," and "tend to" as a way to moderate generalization. These qualifiers facilitate thinking and talking about other cultures without implying that every member of the group is exactly alike. We also add that the validity of the generalization often shifts from culture to culture. That is, if the culture is relatively homogeneous, such as that of Japan or Korea, references to group characteristics tend to be more accurate. However, heterogeneous cultures, such as that of the United States, are far more difficult to generalize about because of the variety of backgrounds, relicions, and ethnic groups and the importance placed on each person's individuality.

 

当其他文化的人宣称所有美国人都有纹身、听嘻哈音乐并且大多吃快餐时，他们是在泛化。当美国人得出十月啤酒节表明德国人喜欢啤酒和香肠的结论时，他们也是在泛化。当人们说爱尔兰人通常脾气暴躁，墨西哥人通常会迟到开会，亚洲人似乎擅长数学时，他们也是在泛化。当有人宣称加州的葡萄酒比法国或澳大利亚的更好时，他们也在泛化。这些例子代表了人们在谈论其他群体时使用的无数文化泛化。当我们泛化时，我们允许少数实例代表整个事件、人群或经历类别。很容易陷入使用泛化的陷阱，因为它们很容易得出。例如，想象一下，如果在与几个来自印度的国际学生见面后，你得出了所有印度人都会说英语的结论，那么对另一个文化做出决定就变得很容易。这些文化泛化很受欢迎，因为它们很容易制造出来，因为它们依赖于有限的样本。此外，当足够频繁地重复这些泛化时，它们就变成了代表整个人群、事件或事物的简化形式。正如你所预料的，跨文化交流的研究，即学习其他人和他们的文化，是滥用泛化的理想领域，因为在讨论他们的特性和“典型”行为时，很容易对整个人群进行泛化。

泛化是基于有限数据的，然后应用于更大的群体。在跨文化交流中，这意味着根据较小群体展示的属性将特征归因于更大群体的人。刻板印象与泛化不同之处在于它们可能不仅仅基于推测，通常吸引听众的积极或消极情绪。例如，“所有亚洲学生成绩都很好”就是一个刻板印象。一个泛化可能是，“记录显示亚洲学生可能会取得好成绩。”

尽管在研究跨文化交流时泛化可能会成为问题，但可以采取一些预防措施（正如我们在本书中所努力做的）。首先，文化泛化必须被视为近似值，而不是绝对代表。你的个人经验告诉你，人们经常不遵循规定和公认的文化行为方式。你可能读到社会一致性是日本人的一个特征，但在东京，你可能看到一位头发绿色的老妇人和一群穿着嘻哈服装的年轻人。在这类情况下，记住英国作家罗伯特·伯顿的忠告：“没有哪条规则是如此普遍的，它不允许一些例外。”

其次，当你做出泛化时，它们应该涉及特定文化的主要价值观和行为。正是这些核心价值观和学到的行为，以足够的频率和足够长的时间发生，才能正确识别出特定文化的成员。如果你审视一下美国的主流文化，你会很容易注意到在从穿着到外在行为的方方面面都给个人主义赋予了重要意义。同样，你可以通过注意到很少女性开车、担任公职或穿着西方服装出现在公共场合的情况，开始洞察沙特阿拉伯的不同性别角色。关于这两个例子，你会注意到，尽管可能有例外，但这两者中的文化灌输的行为是很容易被认出的。你可以看到一种相对一致的模式，比如问候行为。例如，在墨西哥，朋友通常拥抱；在印度，人们鞠躬；在美国，人们通常握手。这些行为之所以能被认出，是因为它们在长时间内的一致性，通常是代代相传的。

第三，当使用泛化时，尽量使用那些可以通过各种来源支持的泛化。不足和/或有限的样本往往会产生不合理的结论。在阅读本书时，你会注意到我们使用了数百个可靠的参考文献来验证我们许多结论。这种“研究”在寻求证实对文化的泛化时特别有用，尤其是当一个人对某个文化的了解可能有限时。

最后，关于文化的结论和陈述应该有所保留，以便它们不显得绝对，而只是谨慎的泛化。例如，尽管这只是本书的第一章，但你可能已经注意到我们经常使用“通常”或“经常”等词来避

 

###### **2.【P.22】 objectivity** ****

客观性

###### **3.【P.22】 ethnocentrism**  ****

种族中心主义

Our next consideration involves the issue of objectivity, one of those concepts that is easier to talk about than to acquire. The very definition of objectivity-"Not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice; based on facts; unbiased: an objective opinion"46--should highlight the difficulty of trying to communicate with other people while suspending personal judgment. The problem, of course, is complicated when engaging in intercultural communication because you approach and respond to other cultures from the perspective of your own culture-and often, consciously or unconsciously, it is difficult to be objective when observing or experienc ing the actions of other cultures. The habit of overemphasizing one's own culture as a template for assessing other cultures is called ethnocentrism. More specifically, as Ferraro and Andreatta note, ethnocentrism is "the belief that one's culture is superior to all other's."*? Notice in the following brief examples how ethnocentrism and a lack of objectivity operate: An American might consider a Chinese tour group rude because they talk loudly or believe the Japanese strange because they do not wear shoes inside their homes.

As evidenced by the above, being objective is no simple assignment. For exam-ple, it is difficult, if not impossible, to see and to give meaning to words and behaviors unfamiliar to you. How, for example, do you make sense of someone's silence if you come from a culture that does not value silence? You might make the mistake of thinking, "How could someone be so insensitive as to be silent at a time like this?" Someone from an indirect culture might avoid a direct refusal of your proposal by saying, "I'd like to study that," but never get back to you. You might deem the person inconsiderate or even deceitful for not providing an honest answer. In both these scenarios, a lack of objectivity can impede intercultural communication.

Objectivity also requires that you approach each new situation with an open mind and avoid being judgmental. To reject someone simply for having a different skin color, living in a different country, espousing a dissimilar worldview, or speaking English with an accent diminishes the person and keeps you from having new cultural experiences. Objectivity promotes learning to interact and value distinct groups of people regardless of their culture, race, ethnicity, religion, country, or gender.

 

我们接下来要考虑的是客观性问题，这是一个比较容易谈论但却难以获得的概念之一。客观性的定义是“不受个人感情、解释或偏见的影响；基于事实；公正的：客观的观点”，这应该突显了在暂停个人判断力的情况下与其他人交流的困难。当从自己文化的角度接触和回应其他文化时，问题当然变得更加复杂，因为在观察或体验其他文化的行为时，无论是有意识还是无意识地保持客观性都很困难。过分强调自己的文化作为评估其他文化的模板的习惯被称为种族中心主义。更具体地说，正如费拉罗和安德里塔指出的，种族中心主义是“认为自己的文化优于其他所有文化的信念。”请注意以下简要例子中种族中心主义和缺乏客观性是如何运作的：一个美国人可能会认为中国游客团很粗鲁，因为他们大声喧哗，或者认为日本人很奇怪，因为他们在家里不穿鞋。

正如上面所证明的，做到客观并不是一项简单的任务。例如，对于你不熟悉的词语和行为，要看到并赋予意义是困难的，甚至是不可能的。例如，如果你来自一个不重视沉默的文化，你如何理解某人的沉默呢？你可能会犯一个错误，认为：“在这样的时候，怎么会有人这么不敏感地保持沉默呢？”来自间接文化的人可能会通过说“我想研究一下”，但却没有回复你来避免直接拒绝你的提议。你可能会认为这个人不体贴，甚至是不诚实的，因为他没有给出诚实的答复。在这两种情况下，缺乏客观性可能会阻碍跨文化交流。

客观性还要求你以开放的心态对待每一个新的情况，并避免偏见。仅仅因为某人皮肤颜色不同、住在不同的国家、持有不同的世界观或带有口音说英语而拒绝接纳他是对他人的贬低，也会阻止你获得新的文化体验。客观性促进了与不同文化、种族、民族、宗教、国家或性别的人进行互动和尊重的学习。

 

###### **4.【p.34】 human communication**

​    In a class discussion on definitions of communication, a student once offered a very clever response when asked, "What is communication?" She answered, "I know communication when I see it, but there is too much going on to describe it." Perhaps this is the reason the English statesman Benjamin Disraeli once wrote, "I hate definitions." While definitions are necessary (they help establish boundaries), finding a single deft-nition for the word "communication" can be troublesome. For example, nearly forty years ago Dance and Larson perused the literature on communication and found 126 definitions of the word. Since then, because the word "communication" is abstract, countless other definitions have been added to their list. If you type the words "definition of communication" into a search engine on the Internet, you will find thousands of attempts at defining this word. Infante, Racer, and Womack offer an excellent summary of why a single definition is difficult to pin down:

Definitions differ on such matters as whether communication has occurred if a source did not intend to send a message, whether communication is a linear process (a source sending a message in a channel to a receiver who then reacts), or whether a transactional perspective is more accurate (emphasizing the relationships between people as they constantly influence one another). Another factor in the lack of agreement on definitions is that the study of communication is not a precise science.

The above critique, however, fails to list the complexities associated with the addition of digital-mediated communication such as television, cell phones, tablets, computers, and the like.

One characteristic that nearly all definitions have in common is that they attempt to stake out the territory that is most germane to the creator of the definition. That specific characteristic applies to our attempt at defining communication.

For us, human communication is a dynamic process in which people attempt to share their thoughts with other people through the use of symbols in particular settings.

在一个关于沟通定义的课堂讨论中，一位学生曾在被问到“什么是沟通？”时给出了一个非常巧妙的回答。她回答说：“我知道什么是沟通，但要描述它太多了。”也许这就是英国政治家本杰明·迪斯雷利曾经写道“我讨厌定义”的原因。尽管定义是必要的（它们有助于建立界限），但找到一个适用于“沟通”这个词的单一定义可能会有问题。例如，将近四十年前，丹斯和拉森查阅了有关沟通的文献，找到了126个关于这个词的定义。此后，由于“沟通”这个词是抽象的，无数其他定义已被添加到他们的列表中。如果你在互联网的搜索引擎中键入“沟通的定义”，你会发现成千上万的定义尝试。因法特、瑞塞和沃马克提供了一个关于为什么单一定义难以确定的优秀总结：

关于沟通是否发生在发送方没有意图发送消息的情况下，沟通是否是一个线性过程（发送方通过一个通道发送消息给接收方，然后接收方做出反应），或者交易视角更准确（强调人们之间关系的不断相互影响）等事项，定义不同。对定义缺乏一致性的另一个因素是，沟通的研究并不是一门精确的科学。

然而，上述批评未列出与数字媒介通信的增加（如电视、手机、平板电脑、计算机等）相关的复杂性。

几乎所有定义都具有一个共同点，即它们试图划定对于定义创建者最相关的领域。这个特定的特征适用于我们对沟通的定义尝试。

对我们来说，人类沟通是一个动态过程，人们试图通过在特定环境中使用符号与其他人分享他们的思想。

###### **5.【P.36】 symbol**

​    You will recall that our definition of communication mentioned the importance of symbols to human interaction. Earlier, we alluded to the truism that there is no direct mental connection between people. Of course, this means that you cannot directly access the internal thoughts and feelings of other human beings; you can only infer what they are experiencing by what you see and hear. Those inferences are drawn from the symbols people produce. In human communication, a symbol is an expression that stands for or represents something else. Although those symbols may be spontaneous and nonintentional (someone sneezes, and you infer they have a cold) or intentional (someone tells you they have a cold), both involve your attaching meaning to a symbolic event generated by another person. In many ways, this act of attaching meaning to symbols is at the core of human communication. Other animals may engage in some form of communication and even make use of some symbols, but none has the unique communication capabilities found among humans. Through millions of years of physical evolution and thousands of years of cultural development, humans are able to generate, receive, store, and manipulate symbols. This sophisticated system allows people to use symbols be they sounds, marks on paper, letters on the screen of a cell phone, sculptures, Braille, gestures, or paintings--to represent something else. Reflect for a moment on the wonderful gift you have that allows you to hear the words "The kittens look like cotton balls," and, like magic, you have an image in your head. Because the image you conjure up for "kittens" and "cotton balls" is inside of you, it is essential to remember that each person "defines" those words and phrases from his or her own cultural perspective. Therefore, it is always important to keep in mind that

"Language symbols are no more consistent or precise than the experience, values, and belief systems of the people using them."

In terms of intercultural communication, it is important to keep in mind the fact that the symbols you use are discretionary and subjective. There is no innate connection between the symbols and their referents. The relationships are arbitrary and usually shift from culture to culture. In short, although all cultures use symbols, they usually assign their own meanings to them. Not only do Spanish speakers say perro for "dog," but the mental image they form when they hear the sound is probably quite different from the one Mandarin Chinese speakers form when they hear gou, their word for "dog." In addition to having different meanings for symbols, cultures also use these symbols for different purposes. Because symbols are at the core of communication, we examine them throughout this book. For now, remember that symbols, by virtue of their standing for something else, give you an opportunity to share your personal realities. So important is the notion of symbols to the study of intercultural communication that later in this chapter (and again in Chapters 6 and 7), we will return to the topic of symbols.

你会记得我们对沟通的定义提到了符号对人类互动的重要性。之前，我们提到了一个至理名言，即人与人之间没有直接的心灵联系。当然，这意味着你无法直接访问其他人的内心思想和感受；你只能通过你看到和听到的来推断他们正在经历什么。这些推断来自人们产生的符号。在人类沟通中，符号是一种表示或代表其他东西的表达。尽管这些符号可能是自发和非有意的（有人打喷嚏，你推断他们感冒了），或者是有意的（有人告诉你他们感冒了），但都涉及到你将意义附加到另一个人产生的符号事件上。在许多方面，将意义附加到符号上的这种行为是人类沟通的核心。其他动物可能会进行某种形式的沟通，甚至使用一些符号，但没有一个像人类那样具有独特的沟通能力。通过数百万年的生物进化和数千年的文化发展，人类能够产生、接收、储存和操纵符号。这种复杂的系统使人们能够使用各种符号，无论是声音、纸上的标记、手机屏幕上的字母、雕塑、盲文、手势还是绘画，来代表其他事物。稍微反思一下你拥有的奇妙礼物，它让你听到“小猫看起来像棉花球”，然后像魔术一样，你就在脑海中有了一个形象。因为你对“小猫”和“棉花球”的形象是内在的，所以要记住，每个人都会从自己的文化视角“定义”这些词语和短语。因此，始终牢记：

“语言符号的一致性或准确性不会比使用它们的人的经验、价值观和信仰体系更强。”

在跨文化交流方面，重要的是要记住你使用的符号是任意的和主观的。符号与其指示物之间没有内在的联系。这种关系是任意的，通常会从一种文化转变到另一种文化。简而言之，尽管所有文化都使用符号，但它们通常会为这些符号赋予自己的含义。西班牙语者不仅会用perro来表示“狗”，而且当他们听到这个声音时形成的心理形象可能与中文普通话者听到gou时形成的心理形象完全不同。除了对符号有不同的含义外，文化还会将这些符号用于不同的目的。由于符号是沟通的核心，我们在本书中全面探讨它们。目前，请记住，由于它们代表其他事物，符号给了你分享个人现实的机会。符号对跨文化交流研究的重要性是如此之高，以至于在本章后面（以及第六章和第七章中），我们将再次回到符号这个主题上。

###### **6.【p.45】culture**  

​    The preceding discussion on the topic of culture should enable you to see that culture is ubiquitous and complex. It is also difficult to define. As Harrison and Huntington note,

"The term 'culture,' of course, has had multiple meanings in different disciplines and different contexts."? These meanings "range from complex and fancy definitions to simple ones such as 'culture is the programming of the mind' or 'culture is the human-made part of the environment.*"18 The media also use the word to portray aspects of individual sophistication, such as classical music, fine art, or the appreciation of exceptional food and wine. You also hear the words "popular culture" when people discuss current trends within the culture. But these movements in fashion and style only demonstrate that cultures are always changing. We are concerned with more enduring aspects of culture and with a definition that reveals how culture and communication are linked. One definition that meets our needs is advanced by Triandis:

Culture is a set of human-made objective and subjective elements that in the past have increased the probability of survival and resulted in satisfaction for the participants in an ecological niche, and thus became shared among those who could communicate with each other because they had a common language and they lived in the same time and place.

We prefer this definition because it highlights the essential features of culture.

First, specifying that it is "human-made clarifies that culture is concerned with nonbiological parts of human life. This distinction allows for explanations of behavior that must be learned while at the same time it eliminates (at least from our study) innate acts that are not learned (such as eating, sleeping, crying, speech mechanisms, and fear). Second, the definition includes what can be termed "subjective" elements of culture-such concepts as values, beliefs, attitudes, norms, and foundational beha-viors. Think for a moment of all the subjective cultural beliefs and values you hold that influence your interpretation of the world. Your views about the national flag, work, immigration, freedom, aging, ethics, dress, property rights, etiquette, healing and health, death and mourning, play, law, individualism, magic and superstition, modesty, sexual taboos, status differentiation, courtship, formality and informality, and bodily adornment are all part of your cultural membership. Finally, the definition also calls attention to the importance of language as a symbol system that allows culture to be transmitted and shared. This means that a collection of people has established not only a set of symbols but also rules for using those symbols.

​    前面关于文化主题的讨论应该使你能够看到文化是无处不在且复杂的。它也很难定义。正如哈里森和亨廷顿所指出的那样，“‘文化’这个词，在不同的学科和不同的背景下，当然有着多重含义。”这些含义“从复杂繁琐的定义到简单的，如‘文化是思想的编程’或‘文化是人类制造的环境的一部分’。”媒体也使用这个词来描绘个人的精致之处，比如古典音乐、美术或对特别食物和美酒的欣赏。当人们讨论文化中的当前趋势时，你也会听到“流行文化”这个词。但这些时尚和风格的变化只是表明文化是一直在变化的。我们关注的是文化更持久的方面，并且关注一个能揭示文化和沟通如何相互联系的定义。特里安迪斯提出的一个符合我们需求的定义是：

文化是一组人造的客观和主观要素，它们在过去增加了生存的可能性，并为生态位中的参与者带来了满足，因此它们成为那些能够彼此交流的人所共享的，因为他们有共同的语言，他们生活在同一时间和地点。

我们更倾向于这个定义，因为它突出了文化的基本特征。首先，明确指出它是“人造的”澄清了文化涉及人类生活的非生物部分。这种区别允许解释必须被学习的行为，同时它排除了（至少在我们的研究中）那些不是学习而来的先天行为（比如进食、睡眠、哭泣、言语机制和恐惧）。其次，这个定义包括了可以称之为文化“主观”要素，比如价值观、信仰、态度、规范和基本行为。想一想所有你所持有的主观文化信念和价值观，它们影响着你对世界的解释。你对国旗、工作、移民、自由、衰老、道德、服装、财产权、礼仪、康复与健康、死亡与哀悼、游戏、法律、个人主义、魔法和迷信、谦虚、性禁忌、地位差异、求爱、正式与非正式以及身体装饰的看法都是你文化成员身份的一部分。最后，这个定义还强调了语言作为一种符号系统的重要性，它使文化能够传播和共享。这意味着一群人不仅建立了一套符号，还制定了使用这些符号的规则。

###### 7.【p.63】world-view

The importance of worldview is clearly affirmed in the following definition advanced by Bailey and Peoples: "World view is the way a people interpret reality and events, including their images of themselves and how they relate to the world around them."* This broad description of worldview makes it an "overarching philosophy" of how the world works and how each person fits into that world. Issues such as what truth is and how one discovers "the" truth are part of the domain of a person's worldview. Although every individual has a worldview, a more powerful worldview also pervades each culture and becomes a collective concept of reality. Hoebel and Frost describe this notion of a culture's worldview as an "inside view of the way things are colored, shaped, and arranged according to personal cultural preconceptions. Like culture itself, worldviews are automatic and unconscious. Hall reinforces this key point when he writes, "Often, worldviews operate at an unconscious level, so that we are not even aware that other ways of seeing the world are either possible or legitimate. Like the air we breathe, worldviews are a vital part of who we are but not a par we usually think much about.

As you can see, worldview provides some of the unexamined underpinnings for perception and the nature of reality as experienced by individuals who share a common culture. The worldview of a culture functions to make sense of life, which might otherwise be perceived as disordered, accidental, and meaningless.

 

世界观 世界观的重要性在Bailey和Peoples提出的以下定义中得到了明确的肯定：“世界观是一个民族解释现实和事件的方式，包括他们对自己的形象以及他们与周围世界的关系。”*这种对世界观的广泛描述使其成为关于世界如何运作以及每个人如何融入这个世界的主导性哲学。关于真理是什么以及一个人如何发现“真理”等问题属于一个人世界观的领域。尽管每个个体都有世界观，但一种更加强大的世界观也贯穿于每个文化中，成为现实概念的集体概念。Hoebel和Frost将这种文化的世界观描述为“根据个人文化预设对事物的色彩、形状和排列的内在视图。就像文化本身一样，世界观是自动和无意识的。”霍尔强化了这个关键观点，当他写道：“往往，世界观在无意识层面上运作，所以我们甚至没有意识到其他看待世界的方式要么是可能的要么是合法的。就像我们呼吸的空气一样，世界观是我们是谁的一个重要组成部分，但我们通常不会过多地思考。”

正如你所看到的，世界观为分享共同文化的人提供了一些未经审视的基础，以理解人们如何看待世界，生活在世界中，并与他人在世界中沟通。在跨文化沟通的研究中，仅仅知道有些人鞠躬而其他人握手，或者有些人将送礼作为商务交易中重要的一部分，而其他人将这种行为视为贿赂是不够的。虽然这些具体行为很重要，但更重要的是要知道是什么动机使人们采取一种行动而不是另一种。一个文化成员看待世界的方式可以在那个文化的深层结构中找到。正是这种深层结构，即关于世界如何运作的有意识和无意识的假设，统一了文化，使每个文化独特，并解释了文化的集体行动的“如何”和“为什么”——这种行动往往对“外人”来说难以理解。对文化深层结构的一些方面进行考察可以提供洞察力和改进对那个文化在伦理、儿童抚养观念、关于上帝、自然、美学和生活意义的理解，甚至是对待死亡的态度。

###### 9.【p.78】deep culture

Why do members of some cultures seek solitude, whereas those of other cultures

become dejected if they are not continuously in the company of others? Why do people of some cultures frantically cling to youth, whereas others welcome old age and even death? Why do some cultures worship the earth, whereas others mistreat it? Why do individuals in some cultures strive for material possessions, yet in other cultures people believe that wealth hinders a "settled" life? Why do some cultures believe that great insight can be found in silence, but others feel that words contain the world's great wisdom? Why do families in some cultures have children living at home even after marriage, and in others children can hardly wait to flee their homes? These sorts of questions need to be answered in order to understand how people of different cultures see the world, live in that world, and communicate with other people about that world. In the study of intercultural communication it is not enough simply to know that some people bow while others shake hands or that some exchange gifts as an important part of a business transaction while others perceive such an act as bribery. Although these specific behaviors are significant, it is more important to know what motivates people to engage in one action rather than another. The key to how members of a culture view the world can be found in that culture's deep structure. It is this deep structure, the conscious and unconscious assumptions about how the world works, that unifies a culture, makes each culture unique, and explains the "how" and "why" of a culture's collective action- action that is often difficult for "outsiders" to understand. Examination of some aspects of a culture's deep structure can provide insight into and improve understanding of that culture's perspectives on ethics, notions of child tearing, ideas about God, nature, aesthetics, and the meaning of life, and even attitudes toward death.

深层文化 为什么有些文化成员寻求独处，而其他文化成员如果不能持续与他人交往就会感到沮丧呢？为什么有些文化疯狂地追求青春，而其他文化则欢迎老年甚至死亡呢？为什么有些文化崇拜地球，而其他文化却虐待它呢？为什么在一些文化中，人们努力追求物质财产，而在其他文化中，人们认为财富阻碍了“安定的”生活呢？为什么在一些文化中，人们认为在沉默中可以找到深刻的见解，而其他人则认为言语包含了世界的伟大智慧呢？为什么在一些文化中，家庭成员甚至在结婚后仍然与父母居住在一起，而在其他文化中，孩子们迫不及待地想要逃离家门呢？

为了理解不同文化中的人们如何看待世界，生活在世界中，并与他人在世界中沟通，这些问题需要得到回答。在跨文化沟通的研究中，仅仅知道有些人鞠躬而其他人握手，或者有些人将送礼作为商务交易中重要的一部分，而其他人将这种行为视为贿赂是不够的。尽管这些具体行为很重要，但更重要的是要知道是什么动机使人们采取一种行动而不是另一种。一个文化成员看待世界的方式可以在那个文化的深层结构中找到。正是这种深层结构，即关于世界如何运作的有意识和无意识的假设，统一了文化，使每个文化独特，并解释了文化的集体行动的“如何”和“为什么”——这种行动往往对“外人”来说难以理解。对文化深层结构的一些方面进行考察可以提供洞察力和改进对那个文化在伦理、儿童抚养观念、关于上帝、自然、美学和生活意义的理解，甚至是对待死亡的态度。

 

###### 10.【p.79】social organizations (institutions)

At the core of any culture's deep structure are the social organizations we introduced in Chapter 2. These organizations, sometimes referred to as social institutions, are the groups and affiliations that members of a culture turn to for lessons about the most important aspects of life. Thousands of years ago, as cultures became more and more advanced and their populations increased, they began to recognize that there was a necessity to organize collectively. These collective institutions, whether family, church, or community, offer their members alliances that they can count on. While these organizations create a social structure that allows members to meet basic needs, they also coalesce the members into a cohesive unit. Bates and Plog repeat this important notion about social organizations, noting, "Our ability to work in cooperation with others in large social groupings and coordinate the activities of many people to achieve particular purposes is a vital part of human adaptation." A number of groups within every culture help with that adaptation process while also giving members of that particular culture guidance on how to behave. The three most influential social organizations are (1) family (clans), (2) state (community), and (3) religion (worldview). These three social organizations working in concert-define, create, transmit, maintain, and reinforce the basic and most crucial elements of every culture. The deep structure institutions are at the core of every culture and provide the fundamental values and attitudes that are most critical to that culture. This chapter looks at the institution of the family and how families shape the social perceptions and communication behaviors of members in a particular culture.

社会组织（制度） 任何文化的深层结构的核心都是我们在第2章中介绍的社会组织。这些组织，有时被称为社会制度，是文化成员为了解生活中最重要的方面而寻求教诲的团体和联盟。几千年前，随着文化越来越发达，人口增长，他们开始意识到有必要进行集体组织。这些集体制度，无论是家庭、教堂还是社区，都向其成员提供他们可以依赖的联盟。尽管这些组织创造了一个允许成员满足基本需求的社会结构，但它们也将成员凝聚成一个团结的实体。贝茨和普洛格重复了关于社会组织的这个重要观念，指出：“我们与其他人在大团体中合作的能力以及协调许多人的活动以实现特定目标的能力是人类适应的重要组成部分。”文化中的许多团体在帮助适应过程的同时，也给予该文化成员有关如何行为的方向指导。最有影响力的三个社会组织是（1）家庭（宗族）、（2）国家（社区）和（3）宗教（世界观）。这三大社会组织协同作用，定义、创造、传递、维护和加强文化的基本和最关键的元素。深层结构制度是每种文化的核心，并提供最基本的价值和态度，这对文化至关重要。本章探讨了家庭制度以及家庭如何塑造特定文化成员的社会感知和沟通行为。

 

###### 11.【p.85】family

That is, racial and ethnic diversity among American families and the diversity resulting from immigration have changed the definition of the "typical American family." Hence, there is no simple answer to the question we posed: "How do you define the word 'family'?" We do, however, feel comfortable with a definition advanced by Lamanna and Riedmann:

A family is any sexually expressive or parent-child or other kin relationship in which people--usually related by ancestry, marriage, or adoption- (1) form an economic unit and care for any young, (2) consider their identity to be significantly attached to the group, and (3) commit to maintaining that group over time.

家庭 也就是说，美国家庭的种族和民族多样性以及移民带来的多样性已经改变了“典型美国家庭”的定义。因此，对于我们所提出的问题：“你怎么定义‘家庭’这个词？”我们没有一个简单的答案。然而，我们认同拉马纳和里德曼提出的定义： 家庭是任何性别表达或父母与子女或其他亲属关系中的人-通常是通过血缘关系、婚姻或收养关系（1）组成经济单位并照顾任何年幼的人，（2）认为他们的身份与这个群体有重大的联系，（3）承诺随着时间的推移维持这个群体。

 

###### 12.【p.98】individual/collective dimension 

Of great importance to the study of intercultural communication are the notions of individualism and collectivism. Even though these two orientations will occupy a large portion of Chapter 4, we want to introduce the terms now, as they play a significant role in child-rearing practices. Before beginning our discussion of the practices, it is important to realize that although the terms "individualism" and "collectivism" seem to be polar opposites, they are actually the end values of a continuum along which cultures can be situated. As Triandis points out, "Most cultures include a mixture of individualistic and collective elements." For example, this blending can be applied to most Mexican men. While they value the collective nature of the extended family,

"The cultural ideal of the Mexican man bravely and aggressively making his way in a hostile world can certainly be described as 'individualistic'»* Granting the intermingling of some elements of individualism and collectivism, there are also many very distinct features that mark each orientation. What are these features? In general, "The individual-collective dimension is a culture's tendency to encourage people to be unique and independent or conforming and interdependent." More specifically, cultures classified as individualistic value the individual over the group. The individual is perceived as a sovereign stand-alone entity. Each person's uniqueness is of paramount value in individualistic cultures. This means that values such as independence, competition, self-determination, pursuing individual goals, independent living, and the "I" being the most important form of identity are the norms.

Collective cultures have a view of the world that is rather different from that of cultures that value individualism. For collective cultures the emphasis is on the needs and goals of the group rather than the self. This means that values such as interdependence, group achievement, cooperation, and the like are stressed. Thomas and Inkson summarize this orientation with the following observation: "In collective cultures, people primarily view themselves as members of groups and collectives rather than as autonomous individuals. They are concerned about the effect of their actions on their groups. Their activities are more likely to be taken in groups on a more public basis.

对于跨文化交际研究来说，个体主义和集体主义这两个观念非常重要。尽管这两种取向将在第4章中占用大量篇幅，但我想现在介绍这些术语，因为它们在儿童养育实践中起着重要的作用。在我们开始讨论这些实践之前，重要的是要意识到尽管“个体主义”和“集体主义”这两个词看似水火不容，但它们实际上是沿着文化可以定位的连续体上的终端价值。正如 Triandis 指出的，“大多数文化包括个体主义和集体主义的混合元素。”例如，这种融合可以应用于大多数墨西哥男性。虽然他们重视大家庭的集体性质， “墨西哥男性的文化理想，勇敢地在敌对世界中 aggression making his way can certainly be described as ‘individualistic’». 尽管个体主义和集体主义之间有些元素的交织，但每种取向也有很多非常明显的特点。这些特点是什么？总的来说，“个体-集体维度是文化鼓励人们独特和独立或顺从和相互依赖的倾向。”更具体地说，被归类为个体主义的文化重视个人胜过群体。个人被视为一个主权独立的实体。在个体主义文化中，每个人的独特性被视为至关重要。这意味着像独立、竞争、自我决定、追求个人目标、独立生活以及“我”是身份最重要的形式等价值观是常态。集体文化对世界的看法与重视个人主义的文化截然不同。对于集体文化来说，强调的是群体的需求和目标，而不是个人。这意味着强调像相互依赖、集体成就、合作等价值观。托马斯和英克森用以下观察总结了这种取向：“在集体文化中，人们主要把自己视为团体和集体的一员，而不是自主的个体。他们担心自己的行为对他们的团体产生影响。他们的活动更可能以小组的形式在更公开的基础上进行。

###### 13.【p.120】perception

​	Take a moment and try to recall having a disagreement with a coworker, friend, of family member that ended with some variation of "I just don't see it that way' tarol us don't understand." Very likely, the inability to resolve your difference it. because you each had a different perception of the problem. In other words, each of you had interpreted some or all of the factors relating to the conflict from a different perspective. That people evaluate stimuli differently is a common cause of interc. Cural disagreements and conflict, and because perception is so important when com. municating with someone of another culture, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the concept.
​	We live in an information-saturated environment. Daily, our senses are barraged with far more physical and psychological stimuli than we can process and interpret. To survive, we engage in a three-step process--selection, organization, and interpretation-to manage the stimuli considered important. In the first step, we selectively decide which of the stimuli to attend to and which to ignore. Next, the selected information must be organized, or categorized, after which a meaning is assigned. The complete process produces your perception of a situation, emotion, or even another person. In its simplest form, perception is how we make sense of the world, how we construct reality.
​	The distinguished theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and his colleague offer a more scholarly description of this process. They contend that just as models are used in science, people construct "mental models ... in order to interpret and understand the everyday world," and the resulting perceptions are subjectively influenced because they are "shaped by a kind of lens, the interpretive structure of our human brains." British author and scholar, C.S. Lewis, has provided a more practical view of percep-tion, and one that introduces the role of culture: "What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing. It also depends on what sort of person you are." Particularly noteworthy is the last thought, because culture is perhaps the most important social influence in shaping an individual. Thus, the relevant sociocultural factors, such as beliefs, values, and attitudes, provide a template for assigning meaning to the many stimuli, which ultimately coalesce to form our perceptions.
​	Two examples readily illustrate the interaction between culture and perception.
The first contrasts culturally based communication practices. In the United States, a direct, forthright communicative style is expected and valued. Frank exchanges of ideas and animated debates often characterize meetings. In contrast, this type of communication can be threatening to people from Northeast Asian nations (China, Japan, and Korea). Their concern for positive, enduring interpersonal relations leads to a preference for indirect communications between valued associates. Accordingly, negative or adverse information is often couched in ambiguous terms. From this, it is easy to imagine how a culturally uninformed American might perceive a typical Japanese speaker as being evasive or even duplicitous and have reservations about enter. ing into a business arrangement.
​	The second example concerns how age is perceived across cultures. In the United States, culture emphastzes the value of youth and rejects growing old. As a result, older people are often viewed less positively. This is evident in media commercials that usually appeal to a youth demographic. According to one communication researcher, "Young people view elderly people as less desirable interaction partners than other young people or middle-aged people."? This negative view of the elderly is not found in all cultures. For example, as you observed in Chapter 3, in Middle East-ern, Asian, Latin American, and American Indian cultures older people are perceived in a very positive light. Notice what Moran, Harris, and Moran say about the elderly in Africa:
​	It is believed that the older one gets, the wiser one becomes life has seasoned the indi vidual with varied experiences. Hence, in Africa age is an asset. The older the person, the more respect the person receives from the community, and especially from the young. Thus if a foreigner is considerably younger than the African, the latter will have little confidence in the outsider. 

​	These examples illustrate that culture influences one's subjective reality and that there are direct links among culture, perception, and behavior. A more comprehensive appreciation of perception and its functions and deficiencies can be achinged by undertanding the following five chanceisics listed by Adler and Gunderson.

- Perception is selective- Because there are so many stimuli simultaneously competing for the attention of vour senses, you focus only on selected information and filter out the rest.
- Perception is learned--Life's experiences teach you to see the world in a particular way.
- Perception is culturally determined- Culture teaches you the meaning behind most of your experiences.
- Perception is consistent- Once you perceive something in a particular manner, that interpretation is usually resistant to change.
- Perception is inaccurate--You view the world through a subjective lens influenced by culture, values, and personal experiences. This tends to make you see what you expect or want to see.

​	The most important aspect of our discussion on perception is that culture "determines both the categories we use and the meanings we attach to them.' In many instances, your culturally based perceptions are maintained in the form of beliefs and values. These two concepts, working in combination, form what are called cultural patterns, which will be examined at length after a brief definition of beliefs.

​	花一分钟回忆一下，你和同事、朋友或家庭成员之间有没有因为看法不同而争执的经历，最后以类似于“我就是不这么认为”或“你不理解”的话收场。很可能，你们无法解决分歧的原因在于你们对问题的看法不同。换句话说，你们从不同的角度解释了与冲突相关的部分或所有因素。人们对刺激的评估不同是导致人际间和文化间分歧和冲突的常见原因，而在与另一种文化背景的人沟通时，观念的重要性不言而喻，因此深入了解这一概念至关重要。
​	我们生活在一个信息饱和的环境中。每天，我们的感官都被海量的物理和心理刺激所充斥，而我们需要处理和解释的信息远远超过我们的能力。为了生存，我们必须进行一个包含选择、组织和解释的三步过程，以管理我们认为重要的刺激。在第一步中，我们选择性地决定关注哪些刺激，忽略哪些。接下来，被选中的信息必须被组织或分类，之后才能赋予其意义。这一完整的过程产生了我们对情境、情绪，甚至是另一个人的感知。在最简单的形式中，感知是我们理解世界、构建现实的方式。
​	著名理论物理学家斯蒂芬·霍金及其同事对此过程提供了更为学术化的描述。他们认为，正如科学中使用模型一样，人们构建“心理模型...以解释和理解日常生活世界”，而由此产生的感知受到主观影响，因为它们“受到一种透镜的影响，即我们人脑的解释结构”。英国作家兼学者C.S.路易斯提供了一个更为实际的感知观点，并引入了文化的作用：“你所看到和听到的很大程度上取决于你站在哪里。这也取决于你是什么样的人。”尤其是最后一个想法，因为文化可能是塑造个体的最重要的社会影响。因此，相关的社会文化因素，如信仰、价值观和态度，为许多刺激赋予意义的模板，这些刺激最终凝聚成我们的感知。
​	两个例子可以直观地说明文化和感知之间的相互作用。第一个例子对比了基于文化的沟通方式。在美国，直接、坦率的沟通方式被期待和重视。直截了当的交流思想和热烈的辩论常常是会议的特点。相比之下，这种沟通方式可能对来自东北亚国家（中国、日本和韩国）的人构成威胁。他们担心积极、持久的人际关系，因此更喜欢在亲密的伙伴之间进行间接沟通。因此，负面的或不利信息通常用含糊的措辞表达。从这个例子中，我们可以很容易地想象到一个对文化一无所知的美国人可能会认为典型的日本人逃避问题，甚至具有欺骗性，并对与对方建立商业关系持保留态度。
​	第二个例子涉及不同文化中对年龄的看法。在美国，文化强调青春的价值，排斥变老。因此，老年人往往不太受欢迎。这一点在通常针对年轻人群的媒体广告中可见一斑。根据一位传播研究者的说法，“年轻人认为与老年人相比，与同龄人或中老年人交往更不令人向往”。这种对老年人的负面看法并不是所有文化都存在。例如，正如第3章所观察到的，在东亚、南美和北美印第安文化中，老年人被持非常积极的看法。注意莫兰、哈里斯和莫兰关于非洲老年人的说法：
​	人们认为一个人年纪越大，智慧也就越丰富，生活为个体带来了各种各样的经历。因此，在非洲，年龄是一种资产。一个人年纪越大，这个人从社区，特别是年轻人那里得到的尊重就越多。因此，如果一个外国人比非洲人年轻很多，后者会对前者缺乏信心。
​	这些例子说明文化影响了一个人的主观现实，并且文化、感知和行为之间存在直接联系。要更全面地理解感知及其功能和缺陷，可以参考以下由阿德勒和冈德森列出的五个基本原则。

- 感知是选择性的——因为同时有如此多的刺激争夺你的感官注意力，你只关注部分信息，并过滤掉其余的。
- 感知是习得的——生活经历教会你以特定的方式看待世界。
- 感知是文化决定的——文化教会你大多数经历背后的意义。
- 感知是一致的——一旦你以某种方式感知了某物，这种解释通常抵抗改变。
- 感知是不准确的——你通过受文化、价值观和个人经历影响的主观透镜看待世界。这会让你看到你期望或希望看到的东西。

我们讨论感知的最重要方面是文化“决定了我们所使用的类别和我们赋予它们的意义”。在许多情况下，基于文化的感知以信仰和价值观的形式维持下来。这两个概念共同形成了所谓的文化模式，在详细解释文化模式之前，先简要定义一下信仰。



###### 14.【p.121】belief

​	What are your beliefs, how did you acquire them, and what do they do? Beliefs are usually reflected in your actions and communication behaviors. For instance, if you believe that a good tan reflects a healthy, active lifestyle, and makes a person more attractive, you will probably find time to lie out in the sun, use a tanning lotion, or perhaps go to a tanning salon. Conversely, if you believe that suntanned skin connotes a lower social status, you will likely make extra efforts to limit exposure to the sun by using sunscreen, wearing a hat and long-sleeved shirt, and perhaps even using an umbrella on sunny days.

​	But what constitutes a belief? Simplistically stated, a belief is a concept or idea that an individual or group holds to be true. Beliefs represent our subjective conviction in the truth of something with or without proof. The degree to which we believe that an object, event, phenomenon, person, or group of people possesses certain characteristics reflects the level of our subjective probability and, consequently, the depth or intensity of our belief. Perhaps you believe that life begins at the moment of conception. This belief may be a product of your faith or some aspect of biology you subscribe to. If you hold this belief, you will probably associate with other like-minded individuals, which will serve to reinforce your conviction, as reported by Chiu and Hong: "a shared belief or attitude is usually perceived to be more valid than one that is not shared. When a person holds a certain belief or attitude, knowing that other people share this belief or attitude [will] increase the person's adherence to his belief or attitude."

​	What makes our belief system important is that it is learned, and subject to cultural interpretation. Therefore, shared beliefs can come to represent cultural norms, or values, characterizing a large collective of people.? For example, the belief in individual equality promotes the widely held U.S. value of individuality and reduces the importance of hierarchy and formality, But even within a large collective, people may hold beliefs that run counter to the beliefs of others. For instance, the U.S. population currently has significant differences over social issues such as gun control, government regulations, the use of racial quotas in college admission, capital punishment, and a host of other concerns. Thus, beliefs and the cultural values they may produce can both unite and divide. But in those situations where you find that someone does not share your beliefs and values, you cannot simply throw up your hands and declare the other person's convictions to be wrong. In today's globalized society you have to be able to recognize the importance of other peoples' beliefs and how those beliefs and values shape their worldview and even their manner of communicating.

​	你的信仰是什么，你是如何获得它们的，它们又起到什么作用呢？信仰通常会反映在你的行动和沟通行为上。例如，如果你相信深色皮肤反映出一个健康、积极的生活方式，并且使一个人更有吸引力，那么你可能会有时间躺在太阳下，使用防晒霜，或者也许去晒黑沙龙。相反，如果你相信被晒黑的皮肤意味着较低的社会地位，你可能会努力限制自己暴露在太阳下的时间，通过使用防晒霜、戴帽子和长袖衬衫，甚至在天晴的日子里使用遮阳伞。
​	但信仰是什么呢？简单地说，信仰是一个人或群体认为正确的概念或想法。信仰代表我们主观上对某件事的真实性的信念，无论是否有证据。我们相信一个物体、事件、现象、人物或一群人具有某些特征的程度反映了我们的主观概率水平，进而反映了我们的信仰深度或强度。也许你相信生命在受精的那一刻开始。这个信仰可能源于你的信仰或你赞同的某种生物学方面。如果你持有这个信仰，你可能会与其他有相似观念的人交往，这将会加强你的信念，正如Chiu和Hong所述：“共享的信念或态度通常被认为是比不共享的更有效的。当一个人持有某种信念或态度，并且知道其他人也分享这种信念或态度，这将增加这个人对他的信念或态度的坚持。”
​	我们的信仰体系之所以重要，是因为它是可以学习的，并且可以进行文化解读。因此，共享的信念可以代表文化规范或价值观，体现大量人群的共同特征。例如，个人平等的信念促进了美国广泛珍视的个人主义价值观，并减少了等级和正式程序的重要性。但在一个大集体中，人们可能持有与其他人相反的信念。例如，目前美国人口对社会问题如枪支控制、政府规定、大学入学中使用种族配额、死刑等问题上有显著差异。因此，信仰以及它们可能产生的文化价值观既可以将人们团结在一起，也可能将人们分开。但在某些情况下，如果你发现某个人不分享你的信仰和价值观，你不能简单地举手投降，宣布别人的信念是错误的。在当今全球化的社会中，你必须能够认识到他人信仰的重要性，以及这些信仰和价值观如何塑造他们的世界观，甚至他们的沟通方式。



###### 15.【p.122】cultural values

​	As alluded to earlier, beliefs form the foundation of values. What you consider desirable for yourself and for the society you live in is a product of your values, which can be held both consciously and subconsciously. Although each of us has a unique set of values, there are also values that tend to permeate and characterize a culture. These cultural values provide a set of guidelines that assist the culture's members in deciding what is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, right or wrong, and appropriate or inappropriate in almost every context of human activity. Institutionalized cultural values define what is worth dying for, what is worth protecting, what frightens people, which subjects are worthy of study, and which topics deserve ridicule. Varied cultural values can create intercultural conflict at both a personal and an international level....

​	As discussed in Chapter 2, your cultural values like all important aspects of culture-are acquired through a variety of sources (family, history, proverbs, media, school, church, state, etc.) and, therefore, tend to be broad-based, enduring, and relatively stable. A culture's value system establishes the expected, normative modes of behavior for members of that culture and institutes the criteria to judge people's con-duct. Unfortunately, during intercultural interactions we have a tendency to apply our own criteria to members of other cultures who usually hold different values. This frequently results in misunderstandings, confusion, and even conflict. Clashes arising from variant cultural values can be related to something as seemingly inconsequential as the appropriateness of eating certain foods (e.g., American and Hindu attitudes toward beef or Japan and Australia over whale meat) or more weighty matters, such as human rights or societal ethics. To help mitigate the potential for value-based clashes, we feel that a good rule of thumb for any intercultural encounter is this: If you consider the other person strange, they probably consider you strange.

​	如早先所暗示的，信仰构成了价值观的基础。你认为自己和社会中所认为值得追求的事物是价值观的产物，这些价值观可以是自觉的也可以是潜意识的。虽然我们每个人都有一套独特的价值观，但也有一些价值观倾向于渗透并特征一个文化。这些文化价值观提供了一套指导原则，帮助文化成员在人类活动的几乎每个背景下决定什么是好的、什么是坏的、什么是值得追求的、什么是值得避免的、什么是正确的、什么是错误的、以及什么是适当的、什么是不得体的。制度化的文化价值观定义了什么是值得为之牺牲的、什么是值得保护的、什么会让人感到恐惧、哪些主题值得研究、哪些话题值得嘲笑。多样的文化价值观可以在个人和国际层面上创造跨文化冲突......

​	正如第2章所讨论的，你的文化价值观，就像文化中的所有重要方面一样，是通过各种来源（家庭、历史、谚语、媒体、学校、教堂、国家等）获得的，因此，它们往往是基于广泛的、持久的、相对稳定的基础。一个文化的价值体系确立了该文化成员预期、规范的行为模式，并设立了评判人们行为的标准。不幸的是，在跨文化交流中，我们倾向于将我们自己的标准应用到通常持有不同价值观的其他文化成员身上。这常常导致误解、混淆，甚至冲突。由于文化价值观的不同而产生的冲突可以与某些看似无足轻重的食物适当性（例如，美国和印度对牛肉的态度，或日本和澳大利亚对鲸肉的态度）有关，或更重大的问题，如人权或社会伦理。为了帮助减轻基于价值观的冲突的潜在可能性，我们认为，对于任何跨文化遭遇，一个好的经验法则是：如果你认为对方很奇怪，他们可能会认为你很奇怪。



###### 16.【p.123】behaviors

​	**Behaviors are the outward manifestations of our internalized beliefs and values.** To illustrate, if you believe that a college degree is the pathway to a better life, you will probably place considerable value on education and diligently apply yourself to your studies. As with almost all things in life, culture also has a regulatory influence on behaviors. Culture tells us the accepted deportment for different social contexts and what is age appropriate, and specifies gender-specific conduct. You know that certain behaviors that are acceptable during a spring-break trip would be considered obnox-lous at a family reunion, that senior citizens are not expected to wear hip-hop or Gothic-style clothes, and that assertive actions are more tolerated when done by a man than a woman. To further illustrate, while on a business trip, a Japanese businessman will usually purchase gifts for his office coworkers. This is because the Japanese believe it is important to maintain good interpersonal relations, and they value social harmony, both of which are demonstrated through extensive gift-giving rituals among family, friends, and coworkers. For the study of intercultural communi-cation, it is also important to know that beliefs and values exert an influence on our communicative behaviors. For instance, traditional Arabs believe that God controls everything about a person's life. This has resulted in a strong sense of fatalism, as exhibited in the often-used phrase Inshallah (God willing). In the United States, the use of personal titles and honorifics when addressing others is usually restricted to formal settings. This preference for informality is a product of the importance placed on individual equality.

​	行为是我们内化信仰和价值观的外在表现。例如，如果你相信大学学位是通往更好生活的途径，你可能会非常重视教育，并勤奋地投入到学习中。就像生活中的几乎所有事情一样，文化也对行为有规范性的影响。文化告诉我们不同社会情境下被接受的举止，什么是适龄的，并指定性别特定的行为。你知道在春假旅行期间某些可以接受的行为在家庭聚会上会被认为是不礼貌的，老年人不期望穿嘻哈或哥特风格的衣服，而男性采取的积极主动行动比女性更容易被容忍。为了进一步说明，在商务旅行期间，日本商人通常会为办公室同事购买礼物。这是因为日本人认为保持良好的人际关系很重要，他们重视社会和谐，这两者都在家庭成员、朋友和同事之间的广泛送礼仪式中得到体现。对于跨文化沟通的研究，了解信仰和价值观对我们的沟通行为产生影响也同样重要。例如，传统的阿拉伯人相信上帝控制着一个人生活的方方面面。这导致了强烈的宿命感，这在经常使用的短语“Inshallah”（愿上帝 willing）中得到体现。在美国，当称呼他人时使用个人头衔和敬称通常限于正式场合。这种对非正式性的偏好是重视个人平等的重要体现。

###### 17.【p.124】cultural patterns（value orientations）

​	Culture is a multifaceted social construct. In seeking to reduce this complexity and provide a greater understanding of how culture guides and shapes people's lives, researchers have discerned that the dominant group within a culture often exhibits similar societal characteristics that are derived from their shared set of beliefs and values. Cultural patterns, sometimes called value orientations, is an umbrella term used to collectively describe those cultural values that characterize the dominant group within a culture. As used here, the term refers to culturally based beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors shared by members of a particular culture. These patterns encompass the conditions that contribute to a social group's perception of the world and how they live in that world. The application of cultural patterns in the study of intercultural communication is beneficial because such patterns offer a systematic structure to help identify and examine recurring values.
​	When using cultural patterns to help gain added insight relative to various ideas and activities exhibited by other cultures, a few cautionary remarks are in order. We suggest that you keep in mind the following four caveats:

You are more than your culture: As discussed in Chapter 1, all individuals within a cul tural group may not share the dominant values of that culture. A variety of factors, such as age, gender, education, income level, personal experiences, and others, influence your view of the world. Because people are more than their culture, assigning national characteristics or typical cultural patterns to a group is a risky endeavor due to the heterogeneity of almost all societies. Think of the many ethnic groups, religious orientations, and political perspectives that make up the U.S. population. Therefore, cultural patterns used to characterize an entire country should generally be limited to the members of the dominant culture in that nation.

Cultural patterns are integrated: Because language is linear in nature, we are forced to talk about cultural patterns individually. It is important, however, to realize that the patterns do not occur or operate in isolation; they are interrelated and inte-grated. In other words, they act in concert. If a culture values the elderly, that value gets attached to yet other values related to respect and decision making.

Cultural patterns are dynamic: Any review of world history will demonstrate the values can evolve and produce societal change. The U.S. civil rights movement gave rise to actions and legislation that led to equal rights for other minority groups, such as women, gays, and ethnic minorities. The interconnected world ereated by globalization has enabled people in other nations to learn about different values and social structures. The Arab Spring that swept the Middle East in early 2011 was in part a result of young people who embraced freedom, independence, and democracy-values significantly at odds with those held by the authoritarian elites. However, even after recognizing the dynamic nature of culture, you need to remember that deep cultural structures are often resistant to change and evolve very slowly. Recall that many of the young Egyptian men demonstrating for free. dom and democracy later declared that a woman's place was in the home.

Cultural patterns can be contradictory: In many instances you can find contradictory values within a culture. A frequent refrain in the United States is that "all people are created equal," but acts of prejudice toward minorities and violence directed at gays continue. Some of the most divisive issues now confronting U.S. society--abortion, gay marriage, gun rights, capital punishment, immigration, school prayer, wealth distribution, etc are a result of contrasting values. Even the divide between conservatives and liberals is at its core a difference of ideologically based values. These types of contradictions are common in all cultures. The Bible advocates helping others, and the Koran teaches brotherhood among all people. Yet in both the United States and many Muslim nations, some segments of the population are very rich and others are extremely poor.

Even with the caveats just discussed, the study of cultural patterns is a worthwhile endeavor. However, when engaged in any intercultural interaction, you should keep in mind that you are dealing with an indi-vidual, and that individual may ot may not demonstrate the cultural characteristics generally attributed to the larger cultural group.

​	文化是一个多方面的社会结构。为了减少这种复杂性，更好地了解文化如何引导和塑造人们的生活，研究人员发现，文化中的主导群体往往表现出类似的社会特征，这些特征源于他们共同的信仰和价值观。文化模式，有时被称为价值取向，是一个总括性术语，用于集体描述文化中主导群体的文化价值观。这里使用的术语是指特定文化成员所共有的基于文化的信仰、价值观、态度和行为。这些模式包括有助于社会群体对世界的感知以及他们在这个世界上的生活方式的条件。文化模式在跨文化交际研究中的应用是有益的，因为这种模式提供了一个系统的结构，有助于识别和检查反复出现的价值观。

​	当使用文化模式来帮助获得关于其他文化展示的各种思想和活动的额外洞察时，有几个警告性的言论是适当的。我们建议您记住以下四个警告：

- 你不仅仅是你的文化：正如第1章所讨论的，文化群体中的所有个体可能不会分享该文化的主导价值观。多种因素，如年龄、性别、教育、收入水平、个人经历等，影响你对世界的看法。因为人们不仅仅是他们的文化，将国家特征或典型文化模式归类于一个群体是由于几乎所有社会的异质性而具有风险的。想想组成美国人口的各种种族群体、宗教取向和政治观点。因此，用来描述一个国家整体的文化模式应该通常限于该国家的主导文化成员。
- 文化模式是整合的：由于语言是线性的，我们被迫单独谈论文化模式。然而，重要的是要意识到这些模式不是孤立出现或单独运作的；它们是相互关联和整合的。换句话说，它们共同发挥作用。如果一个文化重视老年人，这种价值会附加到与尊重和决策制定相关的其他价值上。
- 文化模式是动态的：回顾世界历史将证明价值观可以演变并产生社会变化。美国民权运动导致了为其他少数群体，如妇女、同性恋者和种族少数群体提供平等权利的行动和法律。全球化创造的无缝世界使其他国家的人们能够了解不同的价值观和社会结构。2011年初在中东 sweep 的阿拉伯之春部分是由于年轻人接受了自由、独立和民主的价值观，这些价值观与Authoritarian 精英持有的价值观存在显著冲突。然而，即使在认识到文化的动态性质之后，你也需要记住，深层文化结构往往抵制变化并且变化非常缓慢。回想一下，许多年轻的埃及人在的自由和民主示威活动中后来宣称，妇女的地位是在家里。
- 文化模式可能存在矛盾：在许多情况下，你可以在一个文化中找到矛盾的价值观。在美国，经常有人说“所有人都是平等创造的”，但针对少数族裔的偏见行为和对同性恋者的暴力行为仍然存在。现在美国社会面临的一些最具分裂性的问题——堕胎、同性婚姻、枪支权利、死刑、移民、学校祈祷、财富分配等——都是由于价值观的对比。甚至在保守派和自由派之间的分裂也是基于意识形态的价值观差异。这些类型的矛盾在所有文化中都很常见。《圣经》倡导帮助他人，《古兰经》教导所有人之间的兄弟情谊。然而，在美国和许多穆斯林国家，一些人口段非常富有，而其他人极其贫困。

​	即使刚刚讨论了这些警告，研究文化模式仍然是一项值得的努力。然而，在进行任何跨文化互动时，你应该记住，你正在处理的是个体，这个个体可能表现出通常归因于较大文化群体的文化特征，也可能不表现出。



###### 18.【p.140】high-context/low-context

​	E.T. Hall, an anthropologist, was one of the early pioneers in the study of intercul. tural communication. He categorizes cultures as high-context or low-context, depend. ing on how much meaning is derived from the contextual environment rather than the actual words exchanged during communicative interactions. The assumption underlying Hall's classifications is that "one of the functions of culture is to provide a highly selective screen between man and the outside world. In its many forms, cul. ture therefore designates what we pay attention to and what we ignore. "
​	Hall saw context as "he information that surrounds an event."42 His work revealed that cultures were often characterized by high- or low-context communication, which he described in the following:
​	A high-context (HC) communication or message is one in which most of the information is already in the person, while very little is in the coded, explicitly transmitted part of the message. A low-context (LC) communication is just the opposite; i.e., the mass of the information is vested in the explicit code.
​	Although all cultures possess some characteristics of both high- and low-context variables, most can be ranked along a scale for this particular dimension. To emphasize this fact, in Table 4.3 various cultures have been placed on a contin um rather than using only two opposing categories.

​	

​	E.T. Hall是人类学家，是跨文化沟通研究的早期先驱之一。他将文化分为高语境（high-context）或低语境（low-context），这取决于意义是从语境环境中获得的，还是从交流互动中的实际词汇中获得的。Hall的分类假设之一是“文化的功能之一是为人与人之间的外部世界提供一个高度选择性的屏幕。在它的许多形式中，文化因此指定了我们应该关注什么以及我们应该忽视什么。”
Hall将语境视为“围绕事件的 information。” 他的工作揭示，文化通常由高语境或低语境沟通特征，他如下描述：
​	高语境（HC）沟通或信息是其中大部分信息已经在个人中，而非常小的信息在编码、明确传递消息的部分。低语境（LC）沟通正好相反；即，大量信息寄托在明确的代码中。
​	尽管所有文化都拥有一些高语境和低语境变量的特征，但大多数可以沿着这个特定维度的标度进行排名。为了强调这个事实，在表4.3中，各种文化被放置在连续体上，而不仅仅是使用两个对立的类别。
​

###### 19.【p.140】context

In high-context cultures, most of the meaning exchanged during an encounter is often not communicated through words. High-context cultures normally possess a significant degree of similarity among the people. This leads to similar perceptions, experiences, and societal expectations, which produce well defined social protocols. Because high-context cultures are usually quite traditional, they change little over time and produce consistent responses to the social environment. "As a result, for most normal transactions in daily life they do not require, nor do they expect, much in-depth background information.'* Because the meaning is nor necessarily contained in the words in high context cultures, information is provided through inferences, res tures, and even in what is not said.
​	People of high-context cultures tend to be attuned to their surroundings and can easily express and interpret emotions nonverbally. Meaning in high context  cultures is also conveyed "through status (age, sex, education, family background, title, and affiliations) and through an individual's informal friends and associates."S Because of the subtle "messages" used by high-context cultures, members of these groups often "communicate in an indirect fashion."*6 They rely more on how something is said rather than what is said and are acutely aware of nonverbal cues.
​	As shown in Table 4.3, Northeast Asian cultures tend to be high-context. According to Chang, this is a result of Confucian philosophy, which inclines
"Asian culture toward high-context and collectivist communication that emphasizes role hierarchy and relations rather than the expression of self through direct communication."

​	Low-context cultures typically have a high degree of diversity within the population and tend to compartmentalize interpersonal contacts. Lack of a large pool of common experiences means that "each time they interact with others they need detailed background information.*48 In low-context cultures the verbal message contains most of the information, and very little is conveyed through the context or the participant's nonverbal displays. This characteristic manifests itself in a host of ways. For example, the Asian mode of communication (high-context) is often vague, indirect, and implicit, whereas Western communication (low-context) tends to be direct and unambiguous. "Americans depend more on spoken words than on nonverbal behavior to convey their messages. They think it is important to be able to 'speak up' and 'say what's on their mind. They admire a person who has a moderately large vocabulary and who can express themselves clearly and cleverly... " As suggested at the end of this quote, differences in perceptions of credibility are another aspect of communication associated with these two orientations. In high-context cultures, people who rely primarily on verbal messages for information are perceived as less credible. They believe that silence often sends a better message than words and that anyone who needs words does not have the requisite communication skills. As the Indonesian proverb states, "Empty cans clatter the loudest."

在高语境文化中，大多数在遭遇期间交换的意义往往不是通过词汇传达的。高语境文化通常在人民之间具有显著的相似性。这导致类似的感知、经验和社会期望，产生明确的社会协议。因为高语境文化通常非常传统，它们随时间变化很小，并对社会环境产生一致的反应。“结果，对于大多数日常生活中的正常交易，它们不需要，也不期望有深入的背景信息。”因为高语境文化中的意义不一定包含在词汇中，信息是通过暗示、肢体语言，甚至是没有说出来的部分提供的。
	来自高语境文化的人们倾向于对他们的环境保持警觉，并且能够轻易地非言语地表达和解释情感。高语境文化中的意义也通过“地位（年龄、性别、教育、家庭背景、头衔和联盟）”以及“个体的非正式朋友和联系人”传达。"由于高语境文化使用了微妙的“信息”，这些群体成员通常“以间接的方式交流。”*6 他们更依赖于某种事情是如何说的，而不是说了什么，并且对非言语线索非常敏感。
	如表4.3所示，东北亚文化倾向于高语境。根据张的说法，这是儒家哲学的结果，它使得“亚洲文化倾向于高语境和集体主义沟通，强调角色层次和关系，而不是通过直接沟通表达自我。”
	低语境文化通常在人口中有很高的多样性，并且倾向于将人际交往分隔开来。缺乏大量共同经验意味着“每次与他人互动时，他们都需要详细的背景信息。”*48 在低语境文化中，言语信息包含大部分信息，而非常多的信息通过语境或参与者的非言语表现传达。这种特征以多种方式表现出来。例如，亚洲的沟通方式（高语境）往往是模糊的、间接的和非明确的，而西方的沟通方式（低语境）倾向于直接和明确。"美国人更依赖于口头语言，而不是非言语行为来传达他们的信息。他们认为能够“直言不讳”和“说出心中的所想”很重要。他们钦佩词汇适中、能够清晰而机智地表达自己的人...“如引言中所暗示，感知可信度的差异是沟通与这两种取向相关的另一个方面。在高语境文化中，主要依赖口头信息的人被视为不太可信。他们认为沉默往往比言语更能传达信息，任何需要言语的人都没有所需的沟通技巧。正如印度尼西亚谚语所说，“空罐子响声最大。”



###### 20.【p.145】uncertainty avoidance

Although you may try, you can never predict with 100 percent confidence what someone will do or what might happen in the future, and this is the core of uncertainty avoidance--the future is unknown. As used in Hofstede's research, **uncertainty avoidance can be defined as "the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations.**» As you will learn below, cultures vary in their ability to tolerate ambiguity and unpredictability.

尽管你可能会尝试，但你永远无法100%自信地预测某人会做什么或未来可能发生什么，这就是避免不确定性的核心——未来是未知的。正如霍夫斯泰德的研究中所使用的，不确定性回避可以定义为“一种文化的成员在多大程度上受到模棱两可或未知情况的威胁。”正如你将在下面学到的，文化在容忍模棱两可和不可预测性的能力上各不相同。

###### 21.【p.147】power distance

**Another cultural value dimension revealed by Hofstede's research is power distance, which classifies cultures along a continuum of high and low power distance** (some scholars use the terms "large" and "small" power distance). **Power distance is concerned with how societies manage "the fact that people are unequal.** * **The concept is defined as "the extent in which the less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally**.* In this sense, institution refers to family, school, and community, whereas organizations represent places of employment. The premise of the dimension deals with the extent to which a society accepts that power in relationships, institutions, and organizations is distributed equally or unequally. Although all cultures have tendencies toward both high and low power distance relationships, one orientation seems to dominate.

霍夫斯泰德的研究揭示的另一个文化价值维度是权力距离，它将文化划分为高权力距离和低权力距离的连续体（一些学者使用“大”和“小”权力距离这两个术语）。权力距离与社会如何管理“人们不平等的事实”有关。*这一概念被定义为 “一个国家内机构和组织中权力较小的成员期望和接受权力分配不平等的程度。*从这个意义上说，机构指的是家庭、学校和社区，而组织代表的是就业场所。这一维度的前提是一个社会在多大程度上接受关系、机构和组织的权力分配是平等或不平等的。尽管所有文化都倾向于高权力距离关系和低权力距离关系，但似乎有一个方向占主导地位。

###### 22.【p.148】masculinity/femininity

Hofstede uses the words "masculinity" and "femininity" to **refer to the degree to which masculine or feminine traits are valued and revealed**. His rationale, one that is supported across several academic disciplines, is that many masculine and feminine behaviors are learned and mediated by cultural norms and traditions. Adler and Gunderson feel that the terms "masculinity" and "femininity" do not adequately convey the full meaning behind this dimension and choose to use the terms "career suc-cess" and "quality of life." For our discussion here, and throughout the book, we will adhere to Hostede's terminology.

霍夫斯泰德使用“男性气质”和“女性气质”这两个词来指代男性或女性特征被重视和展现的程度。他的理论基础得到了多个学科的支持，即许多男性和女性行为都是由文化规范和传统学习和调节的。Adler和Gunderson认为，“男性气质”和“女性气质”这两个术语并不能充分传达这一维度背后的全部含义，因此选择使用“职业成功”和“生活质量”这两种术语。在这里和整本书的讨论中，我们将坚持Hostede的术语。



###### 23.【p.156】face/facework

​	Our final cultural value concerns the concept of face, which, according to Hu, was identified and categorized in China as early as the fourth century BCE. **The term "face" is commonly used as a metaphor to designate the self-image a person projects to other people.** **In other words, your "face"** **is your public identity, how you are perceived by others.** And because face is how others see you, it is acquired, maintained, and lost through social interactions, primarily communication. **This process is referred to as facework**, which Domenic and Littlejohn define as "a set of coordinated practices in which communicators build, maintain, protect, or threaten personal dignity, honor, and respect. " **Facework consists of those actions you engage in to acquire or maintain face for yourself or give face to someone else**.
​	In an effort to make a favorable impression on your prospective employer during a job interview, you will try to "put on your best face." You will probably wear your best suit and arrive a few minutes before the scheduled time. During the interview you will remember to sit erect, maintain eye contact, respond to questions with thoughtful answers, use formal terms of address, and avoid slang. These efforts amount to self directed facework because you want to make a positive impression. Complimenting a friend on new clothes, on landing a new position, or when accepted to graduate school are examples of other-directed facework.

​	我们最后的文化价值是关于面子的概念，根据胡的说法，面子早在公元前四世纪就在中国被识别和分类了。 术语“脸”通常被用来比喻一个人向其他人投射的自我形象。换言之，你的“脸”就是你的公众身份，就是别人对你的看法。因为脸是别人看待你的方式，它是通过社交互动（主要是交流）获得、维持和失去的。这一过程被称为面子工作，Domenic和Littlejohn将其定义为“一套协调一致的做法，传播者在其中建立、维护、保护或威胁个人尊严、荣誉和尊重。” Facework包括你为获得或 给自己面子或者给别人面子。
​	为了在面试中给你的未来雇主留下好印象，你会努力“展现出你最好的一面”。你可能会穿上你最好的西装，在预定时间前几分钟到达。在面试过程中，你会记得坐直，保持眼神交流，用深思熟虑的答案回答问题，使用正式的称呼语，避免使用俚语。这些努力相当于自我指导的面部护理，因为你想给人留下积极的印象。赞美朋友的新衣服、获得新职位或被研究生院录取，都是其他直接面对面的例子。

###### 24.【p.169】social identities

Regardless of the definition or term used, it is important to recognize that identities are dynamic and multiple. Throughout life you are continually acquiring new identities and discarding old ones. To illustrate these two points- dynamic and multiple identities-reflect on how you identified yourself in grade school, in high school, and after entering college. As you grew older, you gained new identities and left behind some old ones. For instance, after graduation from high school, you set aside many of the identities you had and on entering the university, acquired new ones.

However, you also retained some of your previous identities, such as the regional identity of your hometown and state. Perhaps you gave up your identity as a member of a high school sports team or being in the band. In college you may have taken the identity of a sorority or fraternity member, and in that case you also assumed the identity of the specific organization.

It should be clear that identity is not a single entity but a composite of multiple, integrated identities; they do not work in isolation, but rather operate in combination based on the social context or situation. For example, when vou are in the classroom, your identity as a student takes priority, but you are still a male or a female, a friend to some of your classmates, perhaps an employee, a son or daughter, and for some, even a wife or a husband. Identities can also be associated with the sports teams you root for, your favorite genre of music, and many other aspects of your social life.

To better comprehend people's seemingly countless identities, researchers have constructed taxonomies categorizing the different types. Turner provides three identity categories human, social, and personal. Human identities are those perceptions of self that link you to the whole of humanity and separate you from other life forms. **Social identities are represented by the many groups you belong to, such as racial, ethnic, occupational, age, hometown, and numerous others.** Social identities are a result of being a member of some social groups and nonmember of others (i.e., the in-group/out-group dichotomy). **Personal identity is what sets you apart from other in-group members and marks you as special or unique.** This form of identity can come from an innate talent, such as the ability to play a musical instrument without formal training or from some special achievement, like winning an Olympic gold medal. Personal identity can also come from something as intangible as a gregarious personality.

​	无论使用什么定义或术语，重要的是要认识到身份是动态的和多重的。在你的一生中，你不断地获得新的身份，抛弃旧的身份。为了说明这两点——动态和多重身份反映了你在小学、高中和进入大学后是如何识别自己的。随着年龄的增长，你获得了新的身份，也留下了一些旧的身份。例如，高中毕业后，你放弃了许多原有的身份，进入大学后，获得了新的身份。

​	然而，你也保留了一些以前的身份，比如你的家乡和州的地区身份。也许你放弃了高中运动队成员的身份，或者加入了乐队。在大学里，你可能采用了女生联谊会或兄弟会成员的身份，在这种情况下，你也采用了特定组织的身份。

​	应该清楚的是，身份不是一个单一的实体，而是多种综合身份的组合；它们不是孤立地工作，而是根据社会背景或情况进行组合。例如，当你在课堂上时，你的学生身份是优先考虑的，但你仍然是男性或女性，是你一些同学的朋友，可能是员工、儿子或女儿，对一些人来说，甚至是妻子或丈夫。身份也可能与你支持的运动队、你最喜欢的音乐类型以及你社交生活的许多其他方面有关。

​	为了更好地理解人们看似无数的身份，研究人员构建了对不同类型进行分类的分类法。特纳提供了三个身份类别——人类、社会和个人。人类身份是那些将你与整个人类联系起来并将你与其他生命形式区分开来的自我感知。社会身份由你所属的许多群体代表，如种族、民族、职业、年龄、家乡和许多其他群体。社会身份是作为某些社会群体成员和非其他社会群体成员的结果（即群体内/群体外的二分法）。个人身份是将你与团队中的其他成员区分开来，并将你标记为特殊或独特的。这种身份形式可以来自天生的天赋，比如在没有经过正式训练的情况下演奏乐器的能力，也可以来自一些特殊的成就，比如赢得奥运会金牌。个人身份也可以来自于一些无形的东西，比如合群的个性。

###### 26.【p.172】gender

Gender identity is quite different from biological sex or sexual identity, which is derived from an individual's anatomy at birth. Gender is a socially constructed concept that refers to how a particular culture differentiates masculine and feminine social roles. ling-Toomey considers gender identity as "the meanings and interpretations we hold concerning our self-images and expected other-images of 'femaleness' and 'maleness.'"

性别认同与生物性别或性认同截然不同，后者源于个人出生时的解剖结构。性别是一个社会建构的概念，指的是特定文化如何区分男性和女性的社会角色。ling Toomey认为性别认同是“我们对自己的自我形象以及预期的其他‘女性’和‘男性’形象的含义和解释。”

###### 27.【p.174】ethnic identity (ethnicity)

As stated earlier, **racial identity is traditionally tied to one's biological ancestry, which results in similar physical characteristics in skin tone, facial characteristics, eye shape, etc**.

 **Ethnic identity, or ethnicity, on the other hand, is derived from a sense of shared heritage, history, traditions, values, similar behaviors, geographical area of origin, and in some instances, language.**

Most people consider their ethnic identity to come from the nation-state where they or their forefathers were born- German or German American, for example. However, some people's ethnic identity is derived from a cultural grouping that transcends national borders and is grounded in common cultural beliefs, practices, and in many cases, a shared language. The three groups listed below are illustrative:

•The Basques, located along the Spanish-French border, who speak Euskara

• The Kurds, a large ethnic group in northeast Iraq, with communities in Iran, Syria, and Turkey, who speak Kurdish

• The Roma (more commonly called Gypsies), scattered across Eastern and Western Europe, who speak Romani

如前所述，种族认同传统上与一个人的生物祖先联系在一起，这会导致肤色、面部特征、眼睛形状等方面的相似身体特征。另一方面，种族认同或族裔源自共同的遗产、历史、传统、价值观、相似的行为、地理起源区域，在某些情况下还源自语言。
大多数人认为自己的民族身份来自他们或祖先出生的民族国家，例如德国人或德裔美国人。然而，一些人的种族认同源于一种超越国界的文化群体，并以共同的文化信仰、习俗为基础，在许多情况下，还以共同的语言为基础。下面列出的三组是示例性的：
•巴斯克人，位于西班牙-法国边境，说尤斯卡拉语
•库尔德人是伊拉克东北部的一个大型民族，在伊朗、叙利亚和土耳其都有社区，他们说库尔德语
•罗姆人（通常称为吉普赛人），分布在东欧和西欧，讲罗姆语

###### 28.【p.176】national character

Most nations are home to a number of different cultural groups, but one group usually exercises the most power and is often referred to as the dominant culture because its members maintain control of economic, governmental, and institutional organizations. This control leads to the establishment of a "national character," as defined by Allport:
"'National character' implies that members of a nation, despite ethnic, racial, religious, or individual differences among them, do resemble one another in certain fundamental matters of belief and conduct, more than they resemble members of other nations."

大多数国家都有许多不同的文化群体，但其中一个群体通常行使最大的权力，并经常被称为主导文化，因为其成员控制着经济、政府和机构组织。这种控制导致了Allport定义的“民族特征”的建立：
“‘民族特征’意味着一个国家的成员，尽管他们之间存在种族、种族、宗教或个人差异，但在信仰和行为的某些基本问题上确实彼此相似，比其他国家的成员更相似。”

###### 29.【p.183】ascribed/avowed identities

​	**Identities can also be classified as ascribed or avowed, based on how they are acquired,**  **a distinction referring to whether an identity was obtained involuntarily or voluntarily.** Racial, ethnic, and sexual identities are assigned at birth and are considered ascribed, or involuntary. In hierarchical cultures where social status is often inherited, such as in Mexico, a person's family name can be a strong source of ascribed identity.
​	By contrast, your identity as a particular university student is avowed because you voluntarily elected to attend the school. Even though being a university student is a voluntary identity, your culture has established expectations that delineate appropriate and inappropriate social behavior for college students. When enacting your student identity, you will normally try to conform to those socially appropriate protocols, sometimes consciously and at other times subconsciously.

身份也可以根据其获得方式划分为归属或公开，这一区别指的是身份是非自愿获得还是自愿获得。种族、民族和性身份在出生时就被赋予，并被认为是归因的或非自愿的。在社会地位经常被继承的等级文化中，比如在墨西哥，一个人的姓氏可能是归属身份的有力来源。

相比之下，你作为一名特定大学生的身份之所以被公开，是因为你自愿选择上学。尽管大学生是一种自愿的身份，但你的文化已经建立了对大学生适当和不适当的社会行为的期望。在确立你的学生身份时，你通常会努力遵守那些适合社交的协议，有时是有意识的，有时是下意识的。

###### 30.【p.197】language

Let us start with a definition of language. Language may be thought of as an organized system of symbols, both verbal and nonverbal, used in a common and uniform way by persons who are able to manipulate these symbols to express their thoughts and feelings. While countless other animals use a form of language, it is the human brain and body that are best adapted for this complex symbol system. In the next chapter we look at how nonverbal symbols operate as part of this multifaceted and elaborate system, but for now we turn our attention to verbal language.

让我们从语言的定义开始。语言可以被认为是一个有组织的符号系统，包括语言和非语言符号，由能够操纵这些符号来表达思想和感受的人以共同和统一的方式使用。当无数其他动物使用某种形式的语言时，人类的大脑和身体最适合这种复杂的符号系统。在下一章中，我们将研究非语言符号是如何作为这个多方面和复杂系统的一部分发挥作用的，但目前我们将注意力转向语言。

###### 31.【p.198】denotative/connotative meaning

We have already explored the idea that when someone selects a particular word or phrase, he or she may not be using it in precisely the same manner as someone eise. Fence, different meanings for that word are built into the communication experience. In addition, meanings are also affected by the denotative or connotative meanings. The "denotative meaning refers to the literal, conventional meaning that most people in a culture have agreed is the meaning for the symbol?" The category of words associated with denotative meanings is somewhat impartial and neutral and seldom contains expressive overtones.There can be general agreement as to what is a tree, a table, a car, and the like.

Connotative meaning is the private, emotional meaning that the word evokes. It is the meaning that reflects your personal and cultural experiences with the word or words being used. Because connotation in language involves the deep structure of words and expressions that are strongly related to culture, they can be problematic during intercultural exchanges. You may observe this point with words such as "free-dom," "devotion," "disgust," "democracy," and "love." For example, you may love good food, love your mate, love your parents, and love your country. Yet while you used the word "love" in all of these instances, the connotations are very different. Understanding the subtlety of these difterences when communicating with someone of another culture often takes time to develop.

我们已经探讨过这样一种观点，即当某人选择一个特定的单词或短语时，他或她可能不会以与某人完全相同的方式使用它。栅栏，这个词的不同含义被构建在交流体验中。此外，意义也受到外延意义或内涵意义的影响。“外延意义是指一种文化中大多数人都认为是象征意义的字面、传统意义？”与外延意义相关的词语类别在某种程度上是公正和中性的，很少包含表达性的含义。对于什么是树、桌子、汽车等等，可以达成普遍共识。

内涵意义是这个词所唤起的私人情感意义。它的含义反映了你对所用单词的个人和文化体验。由于语言中的内涵涉及与文化密切相关的单词和表达的深层结构，因此在跨文化交流中可能会出现问题。你可以用“自由”、“奉献”、“厌恶”、“民主”和“爱”等词来观察这一点。例如，你可能喜欢美食、爱你的伴侣、爱你父母和爱你的国家。然而，尽管你在所有这些例子中都使用了“爱”这个词，但其含义却截然不同。在与其他文化的人交流时，理解这些差异的微妙之处往往需要时间来培养。

###### 32.【p.229】nonverbal communication

Because the objective of this chapter is to examine how and why people communicate nonverbally, we begin with a definition of nonverbal communication. A single definition, like our definitions of "culture" and "communication" in Chapter 2, is difficult to compose. Having reviewed numerous definitions, we propose that nonverbal communication involves all those nonverbal stimuli in a communication setting that are generated by both the source and his or her use of the environment and that have potential message value for the source and/or receiver.

It is not by chance that our definition is somewhat lengthy. We wanted to offer a definition that would not only establish the boundaries of nonverbal communication but also reflect how the process actually functions. Part of that functioning involves
(1) intentional and unintentional messages and (2) the reciprocal relationship between verbal and nonverbal messages.

因为本章的目的是研究人们如何以及为什么进行非语言交流，所以我们从非语言交流的定义开始。单一的定义，就像我们在第二章中对“文化”和“沟通”的定义一样，是很难形成的。在回顾了许多定义后，我们提出非语言交流涉及交流环境中的所有非语言刺激，这些刺激是由来源和他或她对环境的使用产生的，对来源和/或接受者具有潜在的信息价值。

我们的定义有些冗长并非偶然。我们想提供一个定义，不仅可以建立非语言交流的界限，还可以反映这个过程的实际运作方式。部分功能涉及
（1） 有意信息和无意信息以及（2）言语信息和非言语信息之间的相互关系。

###### 33.【p.253】paralanguage

This next form of nonverbal communication is predicated on the belief that the sounds we generate, apart from the meaning contained in the words, often communicate more than the words themselves. Most of you have seen a foreign film with English subtitles moving across the screen. During those intervals when the subtitles were not on the screen, you heard the actors uttering an unfamiliar language but could essentially understand what was happening on the screen just from the sound of the voices. Perhaps you inferred that the performers were expressing anger, sorrow, joy, or any number of other emotions. From the sound of the voices, you could even tell who the hero was and who was cast in the role of the villain. The rise and fall of voices also may have told you when one person was asking a question and another was making a statement or issuing a command. Whatever the case, certain vocal cues provided you with information with which to make judgments about the characters' personalities, emotional states, ethnic background, and rhetorical activity. To be sure, you could only guess at the exact meaning of the words being spoken, but sound variations still told you a great deal about what was happening. Shakespeare suggested this with great style when he wrote, "I understand the fury in your words, but not the words." What we have just been considering is often referred to as paralanguage, which "includes all oral cues in the stream of spoken utterances except the words themselves." Research reveals that those utterances can influence perceptions related to the individual's emotional state, social class and status, personality traits, ethnicity, educational level, credibility, comprehension, and personality.Most classifications divide paralanguage into three categories: (1) vocal qualities, (2) vocal char-acterizers, and (3) vocal segregates.

下一种形式的非语言交流是基于这样一种信念，即我们产生的声音，除了单词中包含的含义之外，往往比单词本身更能交流。你们大多数人都看过一部英文字幕在屏幕上移动的外国电影。在字幕不在屏幕上的那段时间里，你可以听到演员们说一种不熟悉的语言，但基本上可以从声音中理解屏幕上发生的事情。也许你推断出表演者表达的是愤怒、悲伤、喜悦或其他任何情绪。从声音中，你甚至可以分辨出谁是英雄，谁扮演了反派角色。当一个人提出问题，另一个人发表声明或发出命令时，声音的起伏也可能告诉你。无论是什么情况，某些声音线索都会为你提供信息，让你对角色的性格、情绪状态、种族背景和修辞活动做出判断。可以肯定的是，你只能猜测所说单词的确切含义，但声音的变化仍然告诉你很多关于正在发生的事情。莎士比亚很有风格地提出了这一点，他写道：“我理解你言语中的愤怒，但不理解你的言语。”我们刚刚考虑的通常被称为副语言，它“包括除言语本身之外的口语流中的所有口头暗示。”研究表明，这些言语会影响与个人情绪状态、社会阶层和地位、性格特征、种族、教育水平、可信度、理解力和个性相关的感知。大多数分类将副语言分为三类：（1）嗓音质量，（2）嗓音特征，和（3）嗓音分离。

###### 34.【p.255】proxemics

The variation in distance between you and other people is as much a part of the communication experience as the words being exchanged. The study of this message system is called proxemics. Hall defines proxemics as "the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture." * While Hall's definition was advanced over forty years ago, it remains the anchor for most discussions of space and distance in a cultural context. Expanding on Hall's analysis, today proxemics is concerned with such things as (1) personal space, (2) seating, and
(3) furniture arrangement.

你和其他人之间距离的变化与交流中的言语一样，也是沟通体验的一部分。对这种信息系统的研究被称为代理学。霍尔将近距离定义为“人类对空间的使用作为文化的专门阐述的相互关联的观察和理论。”*虽然霍尔的定义是在40多年前提出的，但它仍然是文化背景下大多数空间和距离讨论的基础。在霍尔分析的基础上，今天的代理学关注的是（1）个人空间、（2）座位和（3）家具布置。

###### 35.【p.262】monochronic /polychromic (M-/P-Time)

​	Hall established a classic taxonomy for examining the link between culture and time. He proposed that cultures organize time in one of two ways either monochronic (M-time) or polychronic (P-time), which represents two approaches to perceiving and utilizing time. While Hall's system of analysis has been part of intercultural literature for over thirty years, it has taken on added significance in this era of globalization and electronic methods of communicating. Not only are international messages often received and responded to in different time zones, but the ways people create and respond to electronic "tools" like email are influenced by how each culture perceives the various notions of time. For example, issues such as punctuality, time set aside for socializing, fast or slow paces of life, and the importance of work versus leisure time are just some of the concerns facing people who use electronic devices to send and receive messages to people from cultures different from their own.

​	In reference to Hall's classifications, we should add that although M-time and P-time are presented as two distinct categories, it is much more realistic to perceive the two classifications as points along a continuum. There are many cultures that do not fall precisely into one of the two categories but instead contain degrees of both M-time and P-time.

​	霍尔建立了一个经典的分类法来研究文化和时间之间的联系。他提出，文化以单时（M-时间）或多时（P-时间）两种方式之一组织时间，这代表了感知和利用时间的两种方法。尽管霍尔的分析体系已经成为跨文化文学的一部分超过三十年了，但在这个全球化和电子交流方法的时代，它具有更大的意义。不仅国际信息经常在不同的时区接收和回复，而且人们创建和回复电子邮件等电子“工具”的方式也受到每种文化对各种时间观念的看法的影响。例如，使用电子设备向来自不同文化的人发送和接收信息的人所面临的一些问题，如准时性、社交时间、生活节奏的快或慢，以及工作与休闲时间的重要性。

​	关于霍尔的分类，我们应该补充一点，尽管M-时间和P-时间是作为两个不同的类别来呈现的，但将这两个分类视为一个连续体上的点要现实得多。有许多文化并不完全属于这两类中的一类，而是同时包含M时间和P时间。

###### 36.【p.277】culture shock

For a summer vacation adventure you decide to spend a few weeks with your older brother, an IT engineer who has been working in Beijing, China, for a year. After several weeks of preparation you are ready to board a flight to Beijing, but the night before leaving, you receive an email from your brother saying he will be unable to meet you at the airport. Instead, he asks that you meet at a hotel and provides the following directions:

After arriving, take the Airport Express to Dongzhimen Station. Walk east on Dongzhimen Outer Street. Turn right on Chiuxiu Road. The hotel will be on the right side a few blocks after turing. You can't miss it. I'll be in the lobby.

Sounds easy enough, and the Google map you print out looks quite simple.

On arrival at the airport English language signs guide you through immigration and customs stations, to the baggage claim area, and then to the Airport Express station.

It is only then that you discover that your U.S. currency is not accepted, requiring a trip back into the terminal to find an ATM, where it takes a minute to locate the button that changes the Chinese language screen to English. After purchasing a ticket and taking a twenty-minute ride, you arrive at the underground Dongzhimen Station and make your way up to the street. The first task is to find Dongzhimen Outer Street and walk in an easterly direction. This is when you discover that reality is quite dif ferent from what the map depicts. You are confronted with tall buildings, speeding cars, bicycles, pedicabs, large bustling crowds, few street markers, and only limited English signs. After considerable effort you make your way to the hotel, only to find that your brother has left a note saying, Called away to Shanghai for a meeting, be back in two days. Enjoy exploring Beijing.

Exhausted from the thirteen-plus-hour flight, you check into the room reserved by your brother and set out to find something to eat. The hotel's restaurant is closed, but the desk clerk directs you toward a local place close by. But on arrival, you discover people sitting around small, low tables on the sidewalk, talking loudly, and ordering from a menu in Chinese hanging on a wall. Unable to communicate with the waiter, you give up and stop at a convenience store, pick up some type of crackers and a soda, and retreat to your hotel room. The next momning you set out to explore the city of over 21 million people. Very quickly you discover that finding your way can be a challenge, requiring much longer than expected, and that trying to make yourself understood to non-English speakers is very difficult. After spending the morning exploring a shopping center where you must deal with large, loud, jostling crowds, you feel mentally and physically exhausted and return to your room to rest. That is when you decide to just stay in the hotel watching the international channel on television until your brother returns.

You have just experienced culture shock!

Reactions associated with culture shock can vary widely among individuals and take the form of any or all of three components- affective, behavioral, and cogni tive.? An individual confronting the impacts associated with culture shock can experience a sense of disorientation, feelings of rejection, homesickness, withdrawal, irritation, physical and mental fatigue, and even depression in severe cases. However, culture shock will not affect everyone to the same degree. People who have considerable experience living in diverse social settings will usually adapt much more quickly than someone who has little experience encountering other cultures. Our discussion on the impact of culture shock is not intended to make you apprehensive about venturing into another culture. Rather, the intent is to help you be prepared should you experience some of these reactions.

为了暑假冒险，你决定和你的哥哥呆几周，他是一名IT工程师，已经在中国北京工作了一年。经过几周的准备，你已经准备好登机前往北京，但在离开的前一天晚上，你收到了你哥哥的电子邮件，说他无法在机场接你。相反，他要求您在酒店会面，并提供以下指示：

抵达后，乘坐机场快线至东直门站。在东直门外大街往东走。在秀秀路右转。图灵后几个街区酒店就在右边。你不会错过的。我在大厅。

听起来很简单，你打印出来的谷歌地图看起来也很简单。抵达机场后，英语标志将引导您通过移民站和海关站，到达行李提取区，然后到达机场快线站。
直到那时，您才发现您的美元不被接受，需要返回终端找到ATM，在那里需要一分钟的时间才能找到将中文屏幕更改为英文的按钮。买了票，坐了20分钟的车，你到达了地下的东直门站，然后向街上走去。第一个任务是找到东直门外大街，然后向东走。这是当你发现现实与地图所描绘的截然不同时。你面对的是高楼大厦、超速行驶的汽车、自行车、三轮车、熙熙攘攘的人群、几乎没有路标，只有有限的英文标志。经过相当大的努力，你去了酒店，却发现你哥哥留下了一张纸条，上面写着：“被叫去上海开会，两天后回来。”。享受探索北京的乐趣。

经过十三个多小时的飞行，你筋疲力尽，住进了你哥哥预定的房间，开始找点吃的。酒店的餐厅已经关闭，但前台服务员会指引你去附近的一个地方。但抵达后，你会发现人们坐在人行道上低矮的小桌子旁，大声说话，并从墙上挂着的中文菜单上点餐。由于无法与服务员沟通，你放弃了，在便利店停了下来，拿起一些饼干和苏打水，然后回到酒店房间。第二天早上，你就开始探索这座拥有2100多万人口的城市。很快你就会发现，找到自己的路可能是一个挑战，需要比预期的时间长得多，而且试图让非英语使用者理解自己是非常困难的。花了一上午的时间在购物中心探索，在那里你必须面对拥挤的人群，你会感到身心疲惫，然后回到房间休息。这时你决定留在酒店里看国际电视频道，直到你哥哥回来。

你刚刚经历了文化冲击！

与文化冲击相关的反应可能因个体而异，表现为情感、行为和认知三个组成部分中的任何一个或全部。？面对与文化冲击相关的影响的个人可能会感到迷失方向、被拒绝、思乡、退缩、愤怒、身心疲劳，严重时甚至会感到抑郁。然而，文化冲击不会对每个人产生同样程度的影响。在不同的社会环境中生活经验丰富的人通常会比在其他文化中几乎没有经验的人更快地适应。我们讨论文化冲击的影响并不是为了让你担心冒险进入另一种文化。相反，这样做的目的是帮助你在经历这些反应时做好准备。

###### 37.【p.279】acculturation

We consider culture shock as the initial mental and physical stress experienced, to varying degrees, when an individual enters a culture different from his or her own. If the amount of stress exceeds a person's tolerance level, he or she can essentially become nonfunctional, withdrawing emotionally and physically from the new culture, either returning home or limiting one's interactions exclusively to the local expatriate community. On the other hand, if the culture shock is not severe, as is usually the case, people commence a process of acculturation--learning to become functional and comfortable in their new cultural setting.	

​	Although there are variations in how people respond and in the amount of time they need to adjust to a different culture, most of the early literature on culture shock relied on a U-curve-shaped model to illustrate four phases, or stages, of adjustment (see Table 8.1).
The U-curve model was subsequently extended and called the W-curve,* which included the adjustment period that expatriates go through when they return home after extended periods living in another culture. The greatest appeal of these two models is their intui-tiveness. They are easily understood, appear quite commonsensical, and are simple to illus-trate. Unfortunately, there is insufficient empirical data to verify the models, leading some to consider them overgeneralizations of the adaptation process

​	In more contemporary work, Kim has developed a theoretical model that proposes the cultural adjustment experience to be more complex than the U- and W -curve models.® She sees acculturation as a continuing process of "stress-adaptation-growth." Initial entry into a new culture produces stress because the sojourner's ability to function is normally diminished. In other words, the traveler experiences some degree of stress when dealing with new and different procedures, behaviors, and communication standards. To mitigate stress, sojourners begin to develop and incorporate the cultural norms needed to function competently in the new environment. They start adapting to the other culture. Through continual interaction with people and managing the daily requirements of working and living in a different social environment, the stress-adaptation process broadens sojourners' perspectives and produces personal growth. The three components of stress-adaptation-growth constitute a dynamic process that continues to advance throughout the expatriate's stay.

​	我们认为文化冲击是指当一个人进入与他或她自己不同的文化时，在不同程度上经历的最初的心理和身体压力。如果压力超过了一个人的承受能力，他或她基本上就会失去功能，在情感和身体上都会退出新文化，要么回国，要么将互动仅限于当地的外籍人士社区。另一方面，如果文化冲击不像通常情况那样严重，人们就会开始一个文化适应过程——学会在新的文化环境中变得实用和舒适。
​	尽管人们的反应方式和适应不同文化所需的时间各不相同，但大多数关于文化冲击的早期文献都依赖于U型曲线模型来说明适应的四个阶段（见表8.1）。
U曲线模型随后被扩展，称为W曲线，*其中包括外籍人士在另一种文化中长期生活后回国所经历的调整期。这两种模式最大的吸引力在于它们的直觉性。它们很容易理解，看起来很普通，而且很容易说明。不幸的是，没有足够的实证数据来验证这些模型，导致一些人认为它们过于概括了适应过程
​	在更现代的作品中，金发展了一个理论模型，提出文化调整体验比U曲线和W曲线模型更复杂。®她认为文化适应是一个持续的“压力适应成长”过程。最初进入新文化会产生压力，因为旅居者的功能通常会减弱。换句话说，旅行者在处理新的和不同的程序、行为和沟通标准时会经历一定程度的压力。为了缓解压力，旅居者开始发展和融入在新环境中胜任工作所需的文化规范。 他们开始适应其他文化。通过与人的持续互动，以及在不同的社会环境中管理工作和生活的日常需求，压力适应过程拓宽了旅居者的视野，并产生了个人成长。压力适应增长的三个组成部分构成了一个动态过程，在外派人员的整个逗留期间不断发展。

###### 38.【p.285】stereotyping

Stereotyping is a complex form of categorization that mentally organizes your experiences with and guides your behavior toward a particular group of people. It is a means of cognitively organizing your perceptions into simplified categories that can be used to represent an entire collection of things, processes, or people. A more formal definition can be found in the psychology literature: "A stereotype is a cognitive structure containing the perceiver's knowledge, belies, and expectancies about some human social groups.

Stereotyping is a pervasive human activity due to the need for cognitive structure. The world is too big, too complex, and too dynamic to comprehend everything in detail. To help make sense of your physical and social environment, you tend to filter, classify, and categorize in order to reduce uncertainty. Although this is a natural and necessary process, problems arise when you tend to overgeneralize.

刻板印象是一种复杂的分类形式，它在心理上组织你与特定人群的经历，并引导你对特定人群的行为。这是一种将你的感知认知组织成简化类别的方法，可以用来表示事物、过程或人的整个集合。心理学文献中有一个更正式的定义：“刻板印象是一种认知结构，包含感知者对某些人类社会群体的知识、信念和期望。

由于认知结构的需要，刻板印象是一种普遍存在的人类活动。世界太大、太复杂、太动态，无法详细理解一切。为了帮助理解你的物理和社会环境，你倾向于过滤、分类和分类，以减少不确定性。尽管这是一个自然而必要的过程，但当你倾向于过度概括时，问题就会出现。

###### 39.【p.288】prejudices

A more concise explanation is offered by Rogers and Steinfatt: "Prejudice is an unfounded attitude toward an outgroup based on a comparison with one's ingroup.

During communicative interactions, prejudicial perspectives are often displayed through the use of group labels, hostile humor, or vocabulary that stresses the superiority of one group over another. It should now be evident that negative feelings and attitudes are an integral part of prejudice.

Rogers和Steinfatt提供了一个更简洁的解释：“偏见是一种基于与内群体比较的对外群体的毫无根据的态度。

在交际互动中，偏见的观点经常通过使用群体标签、敌对幽默或强调一个群体比另一个群体优越的词汇来表现出来。现在应该很明显，消极的感觉和态度是偏见不可分割的一部分。

###### 40.【p.292】racism

Racism represents a shameful stain on the course of history and unfortunately continues even today. In modern U.S. history, Congress passed a law in 1924 severely restricting immigration quotas for immigrants from eastern and southern European nations while eliminating all quotas for Asian countries. During World War II, Japanese Americans living in the western states were relocated to concentration camps. Segregation in the southern states denied African Americans equal access to public facilities until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nazi Germany forced Jews to wear a yellow Star of David and ultimately instituted a program of mass extermination. Apartheid was official government policy in South Africa until 1994.

种族主义是历史进程中可耻的污点，不幸的是，它一直延续到今天。在美国现代史上，国会于1924年通过了一项法律，严格限制东欧和南欧国家移民的移民配额，同时取消亚洲国家的所有配额。第二次世界大战期间，日本居住在西部各州的美籍华裔被转移到集中营。直到1964年《民权法案》颁布，南部各州的种族隔离使非裔美国人无法平等使用公共设施。纳粹德国强迫犹太人佩戴黄色的大卫之星，并最终制定了大规模灭绝计划。1994年之前，种族隔离一直是南非政府的官方政策。

###### 41.【p.294】power

Much of our previous discussion reveals that prejudice and racism have roots in issues related to power. Power has played a significant role in relations among people, cul tures, nations, and civilizations throughout history. Spears, guns, bombs, language, ter-ritory, money, and even historical memory have been- and continue to be- used to acquire and maintain power over others. The reason is apparent even though not wholly justifiable-power enables people to achieve their will regardless of the rela-tionship. The integral position of power in all human relations was made clear when British philosopher Bertrand Russell observed, "the fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in Physics. "Granted that there are many kinds of power (e.g., physical, psy-chological, spiritual, political, economic) that occur in a wide variety of contexts (e.g., interpersonal, organizational, gov-emmental), we will focus on power in the intercultural context.

我们之前的许多讨论表明，偏见和种族主义根源于与权力有关的问题。历史上，权力在人民、文化、民族和文明之间的关系中发挥了重要作用。长矛、枪支、炸弹、语言、金钱，甚至历史记忆，一直被用来——并将继续被用来——获得和维持对他人的权力。原因是显而易见的，尽管并非完全正当的权力使人们能够实现他们的意愿，而不管关系如何。当英国哲学家伯特兰·罗素（Bertrand Russell）观察到“社会科学的基本概念是权力，在这个意义上，能量是物理学的基本概念”时，权力在所有人类关系中的整体地位就明确了。假设有许多种权力（如身体的、心理的、精神的、政治的、经济的）发生在各种各样的背景下（如人际的、组织的、政府的），我们将关注跨文化背景下的权力。
